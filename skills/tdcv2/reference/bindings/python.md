# Python

The Python package reads the **same `.tdc` config** and, for the same seed, produces
the **same output** as the TypeScript, Java, C# and Rust implementations. That
cross-language guarantee is one of TDC's core promises.

## Getting it

> [!TIP]
> **On PyPI — version 0.3.3**
>
>
> ```bash
> pip install tdcv2==0.3.3
> ```
>
> That gives you both the library and the `tdcv2` command, with a starter set of data
> packs inside the wheel. See [Installation](../getting-started/installation.md) for the
> whole picture.

## Using it

```python
from tdcv2 import TDC

data = TDC(config_file="users.tdc")
print(data)

for row in data:
    print(row["Gender"])

data.write_file("users.csv")
```

The whole output is `str(data)`, the rows are what you iterate over, one row is
`data[3]`, and `len(data)` is how many there are — the object behaves like the Python
you already write.

Beside those, the package answers to the names every implementation shares —
`to_string`, `to_array`, `iterate`, `get_at`, `to_columns`, `write_file`, `seed_info`,
`preflight` — so an example written in another language reads here unchanged. See
[the same names everywhere](same-names.md). Python's own `to_list`, `rows`, `uses_http`,
`diagnostics`, `count` and `engine` are unaffected and not deprecated.

## One value, without a config

The package also exports `tdc`, which draws a single value from the same data packs
a config reads — no file, no `<env>`, one call:

```python
from tdcv2 import tdc

tdc.person.lastName()                             # Jones
tdc.country.usa.docs.ssn()                        # 699209702, with its real check digits
tdc.person.lastName.many(5)                       # five of them
tdc.seed("demo").locale("ru").person.lastName()   # pinned and in Russian
```

The segments stay camelCase here, unlike the method names above. They are addresses
the packs already carry, not identifiers this package chose, and `person.lastName`
has to read the same way in a config, in the reference and in the other four
implementations. [One value at a time](../getting-started/quick-api.md) is the whole
surface.
