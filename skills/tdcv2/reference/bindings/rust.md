# Rust

The crate reads the **same `.tdc` config** and, for the same seed, produces the **same
output** as the TypeScript, Python, Java and C# implementations — byte for byte, on all
three engines and in Parquet.

One crate, library and command line together.

## Getting it

> [!TIP]
> **On crates.io — version 0.3.3**
>
>
> ```bash
> cargo add tdcv2@0.3.3      # as a dependency
> cargo install tdcv2@0.3.3  # as a command
> ```
>
> The crate takes **no dependencies**, and the starter data packs are compiled into the
> binary, so an installed crate needs nothing else on disk. See
> [Installation](../getting-started/installation.md).

## Using it

```rust
use tdcv2::Tdc;

let data = Tdc::from_file("users.tdc")?;
println!("{data}");

for row in data.rows() {
    println!("{:?}", row.get("Gender"));
}

data.write_file("users.csv")?;
```

## Rows, not strings

A row is the reason to use the library rather than the command line. A test that asserts
on `row.get("Gender")` says what it means; the same test parsing CSV back out of a string
spends most of its lines on the parsing.

Text output and row output read the same generated values, so the two can never disagree.
The row view ignores `<block>` and the text wrappers entirely — those describe a file
format, and a row has no format.

```rust
use tdcv2::{Options, Tdc};

let data = Tdc::new(Options {
    config_file: Some("users.tdc".into()),
    count: Some(100),                 // overrides what <env> declared
    seed: Some("test".into()),        // pins the run
    ..Options::default()
})?;

let first = data.row(0).unwrap();
println!("{:?}", first.get("Address.city"));   // a compound's field
println!("{:?}", first.nested()["Address"]);   // or the whole address at once
```

A sequence that does not apply to a row returns `None`, never `Some("")`. A column
declared `parent="Gender.Male"` has no value on a female row, and a blank would claim it
had one that happened to be empty.

## Options

|                                 |                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `config_file` / `config_string` | Exactly one of the two                                                 |
| `count`, `seed`, `locale`       | Override what `<env>` declared                                         |
| `engine`                        | Force engine 1, 2 or 3 instead of letting the config route             |
| `now_millis`                    | Pin the clock, so a test asserting on a date does not expire overnight |
| `packs_dir`, `data_paths`       | Where packs and `@data/…` sources are found                            |
| `base_dir`                      | What a relative `src=` is relative to                                  |

A refused config comes back as `TdcError::Refused`, which carries the diagnostics **and**
the source they point into — so a caller can render the offending line rather than only
quote the message. `diagnostics()` on a successful run carries what the config was warned
about but not refused for. `seed()` reports whether the seed was generated: an unseeded
run is not reproducible, which is almost never what was wanted.

## One value, without a config

`Quick` draws a single value from the same data packs a config reads — no file, no
`<env>`, one call:

```rust
use tdcv2::quick::Quick;

let mut tdc = Quick::new();

tdc.get("person.lastName")?;      // Jones
tdc.get("usa.docs.ssn")?;         // 699209702, with its real check digits
tdc.many("person.lastName", 5)?;  // five of them
Quick::seeded("demo").locale("ru").get("person.lastName")?;  // pinned and in Russian
```

The address is a string here, where TypeScript, Python and C# walk it as members.
The member shape needs one generated function per address, and a generated surface
could only cover the packs compiled into the binary — while most packs arrive at run
time, and `get("ru.person.lastName")` works the moment the download finishes. [One
value at a time](../getting-started/quick-api.md) is the whole surface.

## No dependencies

The crate depends on nothing. Its lexer and parser are written by hand against the shared
grammar; so are the PRNG, the DEFLATE decompressor, SHA-256, the Thrift and Snappy
encoders behind the Parquet writer, and the PNG decoder that reads a
[drawing](../generators/pattern.md) into a curve.

That is not minimalism for its own sake. Every one of those has to produce the same bytes
as the other four implementations, and a crate that fixed a rounding rule or a hash in a
minor release would break the guarantee this project is built on without changing a line
of TDC.

The one exception is HTTPS, which needs a TLS stack nobody should hand-write. `tdcv2 pack`
and [`<gen type="http">`](../generators/http.md) run **curl** as a child process; if it
is missing, the command says so and prints the install line for the platform it is on.
Everything else — generating data, reading local packs, every output format — works
without it.

## The same names in every language

The object a run hands back answers to the same names in all five packages, spelled
each language's own way. [The table is here](same-names.md), and the test suites
check it rather than take it on trust.

## Requirements

Rust **1.74** or newer.
