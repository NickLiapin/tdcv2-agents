# The same names everywhere

The five packages are one library with five front ends, and the object a finished run
hands back answers to the **same names in all of them** — spelled each language's own
way, meaning exactly the same thing.

This matters more here than a local habit would. Nobody reads this library on its own:
it is read beside the generator, and the example you are copying was as likely written
in another language as in yours. A reader crossing between them should not have to
translate the method names on the way.

| What it gives you            | TypeScript    | Python         | Java          | C#            | Rust           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| The whole run as text        | `toString()`  | `to_string()`  | `toString()`  | `ToString()`  | `to_string()`  |
| Every record, materialised   | `toArray()`   | `to_array()`   | `toArray()`   | `ToArray()`   | `to_array()`   |
| Every record, one at a time  | `iterate()`   | `iterate()`    | `iterate()`   | `Iterate()`   | `iterate()`    |
| One record by position       | `getAt(i)`    | `get_at(i)`    | `getAt(i)`    | `GetAt(i)`    | `get_at(i)`    |
| The run as columns, not rows | `toColumns()` | `to_columns()` | `toColumns()` | `ToColumns()` | `to_columns()` |
| Written to a file            | `writeFile()` | `write_file()` | `writeFile()` | `WriteFile()` | `write_file()` |
| The seed actually used       | `seedInfo()`  | `seed_info()`  | `seedInfo()`  | `SeedInfo()`  | `seed_info()`  |
| What the run will cost       | `preflight()` | `preflight()`  | `preflight()` | `Preflight()` | `preflight()`  |
| How many records it produces | `count()`     | `count`        | `count()`     | `Count`       | `count()`      |

`count` is the one row where the parentheses do not carry across. It reads a number the
config already fixed rather than computing anything, so Python and C# expose it the way
those languages expose a read — as a property, written without `()`. Every other row is a
method in all five. Written `data.count()` in Python it raises `TypeError: 'int' object is
not callable`; written `data.count` it answers.

## Your language's own spelling still works

Each package grew its own names before this table existed, and every one of them keeps
working. Nothing here is deprecated, and nothing was renamed — a published library does
not get to break its callers to tidy its own spelling.

| Also valid       | Where      |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| `str(tdc)`       | Python     |
| `len(tdc)`       | Python     |
| `tdc[3]`         | Python     |
| `for row in tdc` | Python     |
| `to_list`        | Python     |
| `toList`         | Java       |
| `Rows`           | C#         |
| `this[int]`      | C#         |
| `rows`           | Rust       |
| `row`            | Rust       |
| `seed`           | Rust       |
| `Display`        | Rust       |
| `effectiveCount` | TypeScript |

So `data.to_list()` and `data.to_array()` are the same call in Python, and you should
write whichever reads better where you are. The table above is the one you can rely on
being there in **all five**.

> [!NOTE]
> **This is checked, not promised**
>
> `fixtures/cross-language/api.json` holds the table, and all five test suites read it.
> TypeScript, Python, Java and C# ask by reflection whether the member exists; Rust has no
> reflection, so its test names each one in code — the calls do not compile if a name goes
> missing — and compares its list against the same file.
>
> It is guarded because it drifted. Before the guard existed, Python had no `to_string`,
> Java no `toArray`, C# neither `GetAt` nor `Iterate`, Rust neither `to_array` nor
> `get_at`, and this page's ancestors said the names matched anyway.
