# TypeScript

The TypeScript package is TDC's reference implementation. The CLI is the right tool
when you want a file; the library is for pulling data **straight into your code** —
as a string or as live JS objects — without spawning a process or reading a file.

```ts
import { TDC } from "tdcv2";
```

## Creating a `TDC`

The constructor takes either a path to a DSL file (`configFile`) or a DSL string
(`configString`). You can override the runtime parameters `seed`, `count`, `locale`,
and `now` from code, and those values win over the ones in `<env>`.

```ts
const tdc = new TDC({
  configString: `<tdc>
    <env count="4" seed="demo" local="en">
      <sequence name="Gender"><gen type="text" value="Male,Female"/></sequence>
      <sequence name="MaleName" parent="Gender.Male"><gen type="template" value="person.male.firstName"/></sequence>
      <sequence name="FemaleName" parent="Gender.Female"><gen type="template" value="person.female.firstName"/></sequence>
      <before><line><data>Gender,Name</data></line></before>
    </env>
    <block><line><data>\${{Gender}},\${{MaleName}}\${{FemaleName}}</data></line></block>
  </tdc>`,
});

console.log(tdc.toString());
```

The name is tied to the gender through `parent` — two sequences, one per branch.
Without that, the name would be drawn independently and a man would end up with a
woman's name. Exactly one of the two is filled on any given row, so the template
can put them back to back and still print a single name.

`node example.js`

```
Gender,Name
Female,Mary
Male,James
Male,John
Female,Elizabeth
```

Overriding from code — these take precedence over `<env>`:

```ts
const tdc = new TDC({
  configFile: "./patients.tdc",
  seed: "test-seed",
  count: 100,
  locale: "ru",
});
```

If the config reads from external files, point the library at the data folders (and
give it a base directory when you're using `configString`):

```ts
const tdc = new TDC({
  configFile: "./configs/users.tdc",
  dataPaths: ["./data", "./private-data"],
});
```

With `configFile`, relative `src` paths inside the `.tdc` are resolved against that
file's folder. With `configString` there's no file to resolve against, so set
`baseDir` yourself.

The rest of the constructor's options are less common but no less real:

| Option          | What it does                                                                        |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `locale`        | **Overrides** `<env local=…>` — the config loses                                     |
| `defaultLocale` | Only fills in when `<env>` declares no locale at all. The `locale` key in `tdcv2.config.json` becomes **this**, not the override |
| `mode`          | `"memory"` or `"disk"` — the same choice as [`--mode`](../reference/cli.md)         |
| `engine`        | `1`, `2` or `3` — forces one engine, and fails rather than falling back              |
| `stream`        | Legacy alias for `engine: 2`                                                          |

That `locale` / `defaultLocale` split is worth a second look: a `"locale": "ru"` in the
project config does **not** beat a `local="en"` in the config file, and nothing reports
it. Only the constructor's own `locale` and the CLI's `--locale` override.

`preflight(opts?)` takes one option of its own: `output`, either `"materialized"` (the
default — the whole run held at once, what `toArray()` does) or `"streaming"`.

## Terminal methods

| Method             | Returns                               | For                            |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------- |
| `toString()`       | the whole output as one string        | small / medium results         |
| `writeFile(path)`  | writes the output to a file (chunks)  | a file of any size             |
| `toIterator()`     | a generator of lines (one per record) | large text, no full string     |
| `toStream()`       | a Node.js `Readable`                  | `pipe` to a file / HTTP / gzip |
| `toColumns()`      | columns; numbers as `Float64Array` (`double[]` in Java and C#, `Vec<f64>` in Rust, `array('d')` in Python) | numeric pipelines, many runs   |
| `toArray()`        | an array of row objects               | small object fixtures          |
| `iterate()`        | a generator of row objects            | object output, no array        |
| `getAt(index)`     | one row object by index               | point access                   |
| `preflight(opts?)` | a memory diagnostic, or `undefined`   | a check before a big run       |
| `seedInfo()`       | `{ seed, generated }`                 | read / log the seed            |
| `toStringAsync()`  | the whole output, as a promise        | a config with `type="http"`    |
| `writeFileAsync(path)` | writes the output, as a promise   | a config with `type="http"`    |
| `usesHttp()`       | `true` when the config makes a call   | choosing between the two pairs |

`toString`, `writeFile`, `toIterator`, and `toStream` all produce text through the
disk-backed engine, and their memory use is O(number of fields). See **[Large
outputs](../guides/large-outputs.md)** for measurements.

One rule about the async pair: a config holding an
[`<gen type="http">`](../generators/http.md) **must** use it. A network call cannot be
made from a synchronous function, so `toString()` on such a config throws rather than
returning half a dataset:

```ts
const tdc = new TDC({ configFile: "./enriched.tdc" });
const text = tdc.usesHttp() ? await tdc.toStringAsync() : tdc.toString();
```

`usesHttp()` answers that question without running anything, which is exactly what the
CLI does. Everything else behaves identically on both paths — for a config with no `http`
generator, `toStringAsync()` is `toString()` wrapped in a promise. What does change is
reproducibility: a run that calls a service is only as repeatable as the service is.

## Object output

In tests it's usually easier to work with live objects than to parse CSV or JSON —
you can assert on `row.Gender` directly. `toArray()`, `iterate()`, and `getAt(index)`
give you that. Object output **ignores** `<block>` and the text wrappers; it reads
only the materialized `<sequence>`s:

- a simple sequence becomes a scalar property;
- a compound sequence becomes a **nested** object;
- a parent-filtered sequence is `undefined` on rows where it doesn't apply.

`getAt(index)` is **one row's work** and the index does not matter: on a 200 000-row
config, `getAt(0)` and `getAt(199999)` both return in about 2 ms, where `toArray()` takes
around 210 ms for the same run. `iterate()` costs the same as `toArray()` in total but
never holds the array.

```ts
const tdc = new TDC({
  configString: `<tdc>
    <env count="4" seed="demo" local="en">
      <sequence name="Gender"><gen type="text" value="Male,Female"/></sequence>
      <sequence name="Person">
        <gen name="Code" type="regex" value="[0-9]{4}"/>
      </sequence>
      <sequence name="MaleName" parent="Gender.Male"><gen type="template" value="person.male.firstName"/></sequence>
      <sequence name="FemaleName" parent="Gender.Female"><gen type="template" value="person.female.firstName"/></sequence>
          </env>
    <block><line><data>ignored</data></line></block>
  </tdc>`,
});

console.log(tdc.getAt(0)); // a Female row
console.log(tdc.getAt(1)); // a Male row
```

`node objects.js`

```
{
  Gender: 'Female',
  Person: { Code: '7541' },
  MaleName: undefined,
  FemaleName: 'Mary'
}
{
  Gender: 'Male',
  Person: { Code: '1506' },
  MaleName: 'James',
  FemaleName: undefined
}
```

`Person` is a nested object. `MaleName` and `FemaleName` are both present, but only
one is filled on each row; the other is `undefined`, because its `parent` didn't match
on that row. That's what a parent filter looks like in object output.

> [!NOTE]
> **Same values, one row at a time**
>
> The object methods read from whichever engine the config routes to — the same one
> `toString()` uses — so the values agree, and `getAt(index)` costs one row rather
> than the whole run before it. Asking for row nine million of a ten-million-row
> config is a single row's work.

## One value, without a config

The package also exports `tdc`, which draws a single value from the same data packs
a config reads — no file, no `<env>`, one call:

```ts
import { tdc } from "tdcv2";

tdc.person.lastName(); // Jones
tdc.country.usa.docs.ssn(); // 699209702, with its real check digits
tdc.person.lastName.many(5); // five of them
tdc.seed("demo").locale("ru").person.lastName(); // pinned and in Russian
```

Every bundled address is a real property on the type, so a misspelling is a compile
error and completion works with no plugin. [One value at a
time](../getting-started/quick-api.md) is the whole surface.

## The packs a run can see

The npm package bundles the English starter packs; the ones a person installs with
`tdcv2 pack add` live in a store that `tdcv2.config.json` names. `packRoots()` returns
every folder a run reads packs from — the bundled ones, the global config's
`dataPaths`, the project's, in that order — and `new TDC()` builds its own list with
the same call, so the two cannot disagree:

```ts
import { packRoots, scanPacks } from "tdcv2";

const { registry } = scanPacks(packRoots({ configFile: "users.tdc" }));
registry.has("fr.person.lastName"); // true once `tdcv2 pack add fr` has run
```

Pass `configFile` and the project is looked for from that file's folder, as a run
does; pass `cwd` to start somewhere else, and `dataPaths` for folders a
`--data-path` would add.

For a tool that writes configs, the package also exports what the validator accepts:
`EXPR_FUNCTIONS` (every expression function with its arity), `COMPUTE_TAGS` and
`COMPUTE_ATTRIBUTES` (every `<compute>` tag and the attributes it reads).

## The same names in every language

The object a run hands back answers to the same names in all five packages, spelled
each language's own way. [The table is here](same-names.md), and the test suites
check it rather than take it on trust.
