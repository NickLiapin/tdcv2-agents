# A pack read line by line

The other pages introduce one tag at a time. This one goes the other way: a real
generator, start to finish, with every line accounted for. Nothing new is introduced —
if you have read [Lists](lists.md) and [Arithmetic](arithmetic.md), you have already
met every tag below.

The subject is a US bank routing number, the nine digits printed at the bottom left of
a check. Eight of them are arbitrary. The ninth is a check digit: multiply the first
eight by the weights 3, 7, 1, 3, 7, 1, 3, 7 in turn, add up the products, and choose the
last digit so the total lands on a multiple of ten.

Every one of those four passes the real check: weight the first eight digits by
3, 7, 1, 3, 7, 1, 3, 7, add the ninth, and the sum divides by ten.

*The config as a graph: two drawn columns feed one computed column, and every arrow says who uses whom.*

## Who draws and who computes

Two sequences draw, one computes.

`Prefix` and `Tail` hold `<gen>` tags, so they are the only places anything random
happens. `Routing` holds a `<compute>`, so it invents nothing — it reads the two drawn
columns and works out what follows from them. Change the seed and the first two change;
the third changes only because its inputs did.

That split is the whole shape of an identifier pack. The randomness is in the parts, the
rules are in the compute.

*The same compute as a tree, in the Studio canvas. It is wider than this column — click to open it full size and move around it.*

## Line by line

### The base: eight digits from two columns

```xml
<let name="base"><concat><field name="Prefix"/><field name="Tail"/></concat></let>
```

`<field>` pulls in a column that already exists; `<concat>` glues the two strings into
one eight-character string; `<let>` gives that string the name `base`.

`base` is now readable as `<use name="base"/>` for the rest of this `<compute>` — and
only after this line. A name is bound once, read forward, and never rebound.

### The weighted sum: a fold with a lookup inside

```xml
<reduce>
    <over><use name="base"/></over>
    <init><int v="0"/></init>
    <do>
        <add>
            <acc/>
            <multiply>
                <current/>
                <at><in><list v="3,7,1,3,7,1,3,7"/></in><index><current_index/></index></at>
            </multiply>
        </add>
    </do>
</reduce>
```

Three slots, in the roles they always have. `<over>` is the shelf — `base` is a string,
so it walks one character at a time, eight steps. `<init>` puts `0` in the jar. `<do>`
runs once per step.

Inside `<do>`, read outward from the middle:

1. `<current_index/>` is the step number, counting from 0.
2. `<at>` uses it to pick the matching weight out of the eight-element list. This is a
   lookup table standing in for eight branches of a conditional.
3. `<multiply>` multiplies the digit in hand by that weight.
4. `<add>` adds the product to what is already in the jar, `<acc/>`.

Walking `07718758`'s first eight digits `0 7 7 1 8 7 5 8` against the weights
3, 7, 1, 3, 7, 1, 3, 7:

| Step | `<current/>` | weight | product | jar after |
| ---: | -----------: | -----: | ------: | --------: |
|    1 |            0 |      3 |       0 |         0 |
|    2 |            7 |      7 |      49 |        49 |
|    3 |            7 |      1 |       7 |        56 |
|    4 |            1 |      3 |       3 |        59 |
|    5 |            8 |      7 |      56 |       115 |
|    6 |            7 |      1 |       7 |       122 |
|    7 |            5 |      3 |      15 |       137 |
|    8 |            8 |      7 |      56 |       193 |

So `weighted` is 193 for that record.

### The check digit: what is missing to reach a round ten

```xml
<mod><subtract><int v="10"/><mod><use name="weighted"/><int v="10"/></mod></subtract><int v="10"/></mod>
```

Read it inside out. `193 mod 10` is 3 — how far past a multiple of ten the sum already
is. `10 - 3` is 7 — how much more it needs. The outer `<mod>` handles the one case where
that arithmetic misbehaves: when the sum already ends in 0, `10 - 0` is 10, and a check
digit has to be a single digit, so `10 mod 10` brings it back to 0.

That outer `<mod>` is the kind of line that looks redundant until the one record in ten
that needs it.

### The answer

```xml
<result><concat><use name="base"/><use name="check"/></concat></result>
```

Eight digits and the ninth, joined. `<result>` is where a `<compute>` ends, and its value
is what `${{Routing}}` prints. A block ends once, so nothing may sit beside `<result>`.

## What to copy from this

The shape transfers to any check-digit scheme:

1. Draw the arbitrary part with `<gen>`, in one or more sequences.
2. Name it with `<let>` so the rest of the block can read it.
3. Fold it with `<reduce>`, using `<at>` for per-position weights instead of branches.
4. Turn the total into a digit with `<mod>` arithmetic.
5. `<concat>` the parts and hand them to `<result>`.

Luhn, ISBN, IBAN's mod-97 and the national ID schemes in the bundled packs are all this
same five-step shape with different weights and a different final step.
