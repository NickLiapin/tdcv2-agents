# Multiple values in a cell (`repeat`)

**Use it when** one field isn't always one value. An order has one item or five.
An article carries a single tag or four. A sensor reports three readings at once.
`repeat` makes a single [`<gen>`](../generators/overview.md) emit **several**
values into one cell instead of one — and the count can vary from row to row.

Before `repeat`, the only way to fake a variable-length field was five separate
sequences with half the rows left blank. Now it's one attribute on the generator.

Example outputs below are illustrative — the exact values a given `seed`
produces can shift between core versions, but the **structure** each form
guarantees (how many values land in a cell, and how they're joined) does not.

*The first eight rows of a 2000-row run, and the length of every list in it.*

- **A** — one cell per row, holding between one and four values
- **B** — how many rows came out with each length — the counts are an exact quota, not an approximation

## At a glance

| Attribute       | What it means                                                       |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `repeat="3"`    | exactly three values                                                |
| `repeat="1..5"` | between one and five — every length gets an exact share of the rows |
| `repeat="0..3"` | zero is allowed — the cell can come out empty                       |
| `separator=" "` | what to join with; defaults to a comma                              |

The upper bound is **64**. `separator` without `repeat` is an error — there's
nothing to join.

## `repeat="1..5"` — a varying count per row

This is the everyday case. An order line should hold however many items the
order happened to have. Here each basket draws one to four SKUs, joined by
spaces:

```xml
<env count="8" seed="basket-7">
    <sequence name="Id"><gen type="increment" value="1"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Items">
        <gen type="regex" value="SKU-[0-9]{4}" repeat="1..4" separator=" "/>
    </sequence>
</env>
<block>
    <line><data>order ${{Id}}: ${{Items}}</data></line>
</block>
```

`./run basket.tdc (count=8)`

```
order 1: SKU-5365 SKU-2241 SKU-0758 SKU-9382
order 2: SKU-2033 SKU-3412 SKU-3799
order 3: SKU-3278
order 4: SKU-3984 SKU-4578
order 5: SKU-5351 SKU-5903
order 6: SKU-3412
order 7: SKU-0258 SKU-3326 SKU-1157
order 8: SKU-3205 SKU-4821 SKU-3618 SKU-2450
```

Basket size varies from one item to four, the way real orders do. **Why:** any field
whose real-world cardinality varies (order items, tags, phone numbers, addresses)
maps directly onto a `min..max` range.

## `repeat="3"` — a fixed number of values

Give a single integer and every cell holds exactly that many values. Useful for
fixed-shape tokens — a three-group code, an (x, y, z) triple, a set of three
readings:

```xml
<sequence name="Code">
    <gen type="regex" value="[A-Z]{2}" repeat="3" separator="-"/>
</sequence>
```

`./run code.tdc (count=6)`

```
QR-LM-ZP
BX-TT-KD
WM-AE-RH
NP-CC-JU
FL-GO-VS
DK-HY-QN
```

**Why:** when the shape is fixed and only the values vary, `repeat="3"` is
clearer than three separate fields glued together in the output block.

## `repeat="0..3"` — zero is allowed

A range that starts at `0` lets a cell come out **empty**. That's exactly right
for an optional list — some articles have no tags at all:

```xml
<sequence name="Tags">
    <gen type="text" value="news,tech,sport,food,travel" repeat="0..2" separator=", "/>
</sequence>
```

`./run tags.tdc (count=6)`

```
article 1: tech, news
article 2:
article 3: sport
article 4:
article 5: travel, food
article 6: news
```

Articles 2 and 4 drew a length of zero, so their cells are blank — not a special
value, just an empty list. **Why:** "sometimes present, sometimes absent" is a
real data shape, and `0..n` models it without a second sequence.

## `lengths=` — how many rows get each count

Without it every length is equally likely, and "equally" here is **exact** rather than
approximate: the lengths are laid out as a quota, so `repeat="0..5"` gives each of the six
counts one sixth of the rows, with no sampling noise at all.

Real one-to-many data never looks like that. Orders per customer, visits per patient,
transactions per account: most parents have one or two children, a few have twenty.
`lengths=` gives the share of rows that get each count, lowest first:

```xml
<gen type="number" value="100..999" repeat="0..5" lengths="40,25,15,10,7,3" separator=";"/>
```

`./run orders.tdc (8 rows)`

```
[896;648;701;334]
[]
[765]
[342;706]
[447;991;569]
[]
[148]
[]
```

Over 20,000 rows the shares come out to the hundredth, because they are a quota and not a
draw:

`./run orders.tdc (20,000 rows, counted)`

```
0: 40.00%  1: 25.00%  2: 15.00%  3: 10.00%  4: 7.00%  5: 3.00%
```

One share per possible length, and they must sum to 100 — the same arithmetic `percent=`
uses. Five shares for six lengths is refused rather than repaired: a config written that way
had a shape in mind, and guessing which one was forgotten is not this engine's job.

> [`<gen type="pattern" mode="density">`](../generators/pattern.md) reproduces a *shape* to

> wrong one for "exactly this many".

## `separator=` — how the values are joined

Without `separator`, the values are joined with a comma. Set it to any string to
match the format you're building — a space, a pipe, `" | "`, `"; "`, whatever the
column needs.

```xml
<sequence name="Letters">
    <gen type="text" value="a,b,c,d,e" repeat="3"/>          <!-- default comma -->
</sequence>
<sequence name="Piped">
    <gen type="text" value="a,b,c,d,e" repeat="3" separator=" | "/>
</sequence>
```

`./run sep.tdc (count=3) — default vs. piped`

```
d,a,c        d | a | c
b,e,b        b | e | b
a,c,e        a | c | e
```

**Why:** the joined cell is just text, so the separator is how you make it fit a
CSV column, a JSON-ish inline list, or a human-readable line.

## `accumulate=` — a running total across the list

The values in a cell are often steps of one thing rather than three unrelated draws: the
lines of a receipt, the legs of a trip, the minutes of a session. `accumulate=` replaces
the list with its running total.

```xml
<gen type="number" value="150..900" decimals="2" repeat="3" separator=", " accumulate="sum"/>
```

`./run cart.tdc`

```
239.10, 568.84, 809.63
791.92, 1059.68, 1593.11
473.43, 785.34, 1006.51
```

The left column is the same generator without `accumulate=`; the right one is with it. The
last element is the total, and every element before it is the subtotal at that point.

| `accumulate=` | Each element becomes                              |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `sum`         | everything up to and including it, added up       |
| `max`         | the largest value seen so far — a high-water mark |
| `min`         | the smallest so far                               |

`./run peaks.tdc`

```
пик 22,22,22,83,83
пик 11,48,54,54,54
пик 57,60,62,62,93
```

**The arithmetic is exact, including decimals.** The sum is computed on whole numbers
scaled by the widest fraction in the list, never on floating point — so `19.99 + 0.01` is
`20.00` and not `20.000000000000004`, and it is the same `20.00` in all five
implementations.

**`min` and `max` return an element that already exists**, so its own spelling survives. A
value drawn as `007` stays `007` rather than becoming `7`.

**An empty element is passed over.** [`missing=`](../guides/missing-data.md) blanks some
cells, and a blank one leaves the accumulator alone rather than counting as a zero — "no
reading that day" should not reset a meter.

`accumulate=` needs a list, so it needs `repeat=` (`TDC237`), and the operation is one of
those three (`TDC238`).

## Missing, anomalies, and formatting act **per element**

This is the one thing to remember: because `repeat` lives on the **generator**,
everything that generator does happens to **each value separately**, not to the
cell as a whole. Missing-data blanks, anomaly injection, and
[output formatting](../guides/masks-and-case.md) all operate element by element.

The practical payoff shows up with a flag column. When a generator marks
anomalies, its flag field becomes a list of the **same length** as the readings —
one flag per reading, lined up exactly:

`./run sensors.tdc (readings -> anomaly flags)`

```
5,500,100     ->   false,true,true
800,200,1     ->   true,true,false
6,8,7         ->   false,false,false
100,300,900   ->   true,true,true
```

The flag sits precisely where the outlier is. That lets you test a detector
exactly, instead of at the coarse "something in this batch was off" level —
you know **which reading broke**.

If instead you want "the whole record is corrupt," that's a different job for a
different tool: a `<mix>` branch with a record-level `flag`, not `repeat`.

## Word lists and exact proportions

The most common list is a set of tags, and `repeat` works straight on the
[`text`](../generators/text.md) generator:

```xml
<sequence name="Tags">
    <gen type="text" value="news,tech,sport,food,travel" repeat="1..3" separator=", "/>
</sequence>
```

`./run tags.tdc (count=6)`

```
article 1: [food]
article 2: [tech, news]
article 3: [news, tech, travel]
article 4: [sport, tech]
article 5: [travel, travel, news]
article 6: [sport]
```

Here's the subtle part. [`text`](../generators/text.md) lays its values out to
**exact** proportions via a [`percent`](../generators/text.md) list, not
approximate ones — and that guarantee **survives** `repeat`, for both a fixed
count and a range.

It works because TDC **decides all the lengths first** (also by an exact quota),
and only then fills the resulting slots. Since the lengths are known up front, so
is the total number of slots — nothing gets generated and thrown away, and no
quota is lost.

Checked on 120,000 rows with `repeat="1..4"` and `percent="40,30,20,10"`:

`./run tags-big.tdc (count=120000, tallied)`

```
row lengths:   30000 x1    30000 x2    30000 x3    30000 x4     (exactly a quarter each)
values:       120000 news   90000 tech   60000 sport  30000 food   (exactly 40/30/20/10)
```

300,000 slots in total, and the distribution lands exactly. Run it with
`--jobs 7` and you get the same numbers — the file is byte-for-byte identical.

## No repeats inside one cell: `distinct`

Sometimes a repeated value is wrong rather than merely uninteresting. A double
first name is the clearest case: `Jesus Jesus Gonzales` is not a name.

`distinct="true"` draws the row's values **without replacement**, so a cell
cannot hold the same value twice:

```xml
<gen name="First" type="template" value="person.male.firstName"
     repeat="2" separator=" " distinct="true"/>
```

`./run names.tdc (count=5)`

```
William Robert Jones
Matthew Tyrone Smith
James Zachery Williams
Devin Jacob Brown
Thomas Preston Johnson
```

Side by side, the same five tags with and without it:

```xml
<gen name="Tags"   type="text" value="news,tech,sport,food,travel" repeat="1..3" separator=", "/>
<gen name="Unique" type="text" value="news,tech,sport,food,travel" repeat="1..3" separator=", " distinct="true"/>
```

`./run tags.tdc (count=6)`

```
tech   |   sport, tech, news
news, food, food   |   travel, tech
sport   |   news
news, travel   |   sport, travel
tech, travel   |   tech
sport, sport, tech   |   travel, news, food
```

`food, food` and `sport, sport` on the left; never on the right.

### What it costs

`distinct` is not free, and the price is worth understanding before you reach
for it.

Without it, a listed column lays its values out across the **whole run** as an
exact quota — that is what makes `percent` land on the nose. A row that must not
repeat itself cannot read a pre-decided slot; it has to **choose**. So under
`distinct` the column draws per row instead, and its overall frequencies become
**approximate rather than exact**.

A weighted [data pack](../data-packs/overview.md) still works and still
leans on its frequent values — common first names stay common. It simply no
longer lands on an exact count over the run.

That is why `percent` and `distinct` cannot both sit on one generator: `percent`
promises exactness the column can no longer deliver, so TDC refuses the pair
([`TDC291`](../reference/errors.md)) instead of quietly honouring one and
dropping the other. If you want proportions over list **lengths**, put them on a
[`<mix>`](./mix.md) or `<switch>` outside, with `repeat`
on the generator inside.

Everything else about `repeat` is unchanged: rows stay independent, so streaming
and `--jobs` keep working.

### When it can't be done

Five values cannot yield six different ones. TDC says so rather than quietly
handing back a shorter list:

| what you wrote | what happens |
| :--- | :--- |
| `distinct="true"` with no `repeat=` | `TDC290` — one value cannot repeat itself |
| `percent=` and `distinct=` together | `TDC291` — see above |
| `repeat="1..10"` over a five-value list | `TDC292`, before the run — the list is in the config |
| the same, from a pack or a file | the same refusal, at run time — the pool is only known then |

The last row is the reason for the split. A `value="a,b,c"` list is countable
from the config, so `tdcv2 check` catches it; a pack file or a CSV column is
read while generating, so the refusal has to wait until then. Either way it is a
refusal, never a short cell.

The run-time refusal has a number behind it: the draw gives up after **64** tries at
finding another value the cell has not already used, and says so. A generator with more
than 64 values but a heavy skew — a regex that almost always produces the same string —
can hit that even though its pool is large enough on paper. `check` calls such a config
valid, because whether the pool is reachable is not knowable from the config.

## Where `repeat` won't work

A few generators tie each value to the **row number**, and `repeat` can't apply
to them:

| Generator                                                                            | Why not                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| [`increment`](../generators/counters.md), `decrement`                               | the value depends on the row's position   |
| [`timeseries`](../generators/timeseries.md), [`pattern`](../generators/pattern.md) | same — the value is bound to the position |

For these, an element's index would depend on how long **all the previous rows**
turned out to be — a random quantity. That would make a row impossible to compute
without its neighbors, breaking streaming and `--jobs`. TDC refuses with a clear
error (`TDC204`) rather than silently doing the wrong thing.

## What else TDC won't accept

| What you wrote                       | What it says                                                  |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `repeat="many"`, `repeat="1.5"`      | `TDC195` — an integer is required                             |
| `repeat="-1"`, `repeat="5..2"`       | `TDC195` — the minimum can't be negative or above the maximum |
| `repeat="1..65"`                     | `TDC195` — the upper bound is 64                              |
| `separator=";"` without `repeat`     | `TDC198` — nothing to join                                    |
| `repeat` or `separator` on a `<mix>` | `TDC196` — a mix picks one branch; it doesn't build a list    |

On that last one: a `<mix>` **chooses** among branches, so "repeat it" has no
well-defined meaning. If you want a list inside a branch, put `repeat` on the
[`<gen>`](../generators/overview.md) inside the `<case>`.

## At scale

`repeat` doesn't get in the way of streaming or `--jobs`: a row is still computed
independently of its neighbors. Two separate things make that work, and they are
easy to mix up:

- **The length** of each row's list comes from the whole-run quota above. A row can
  look its length up from its own row number — no neighbour needed.
- **The values** are then drawn for the **maximum** (five, in the case of
  `repeat="1..5"`) and the extras discarded, so the draw position depends only on the
  row number and never on how long the previous rows turned out.

That's what lets a row be computed without computing the ones before it, and it's
why multi-threaded output matches single-threaded byte for byte.

That's also where the cap of 64 comes from: a large `repeat` costs real work even
when the row ends up with only two elements. See
**[Large outputs](../guides/large-outputs.md)**.

## In Parquet, a real list

When you export to Parquet, a `repeat` column becomes a **true list**, not a
joined string. The element type is inferred automatically:

`parquet schema`

```
id       INT64       REQUIRED
items    LIST of BYTE_ARRAY (UTF8)
prices   LIST of INT64
city     BYTE_ARRAY  REQUIRED
```

`parquet rows (as JSON)`

```
{"id":1,"items":["bread","cheese"],        "prices":[262],         "city":"Boston"}
{"id":3,"items":["cheese","milk"],         "prices":[469,241,188], "city":"Boston"}
{"id":6,"items":["milk","bread","coffee"], "prices":[81,262],      "city":"Denver"}
```

An empty list stays an empty list — it doesn't vanish. And a missing value inside
a list produces a **real `null`** in the element's place: in text that's
indistinguishable from an empty string, but Parquet records it exactly.

`parquet — a null element`

```
{"t":[6,5,null]}
```

You can also set the type by hand: `type="[]int64"`,
`type="[]decimal(18,2)"`. Writing `type="[]int64|null"` means "a list whose
**element** may be null" — precisely what a per-element missing value produces.
