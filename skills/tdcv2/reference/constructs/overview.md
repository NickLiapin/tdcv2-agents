# Constructs

A [generator](../generators/overview.md) produces a value. A **construct** decides
what happens around that value: _which_ one is used, _whether_ it appears at all, _how
many_ of them go in a cell, whether it may repeat, and how many rows one record turns
into.

That's the whole list: six constructs. Everything else in TDC is either a generator, a
place to put text, or a way to compute something from values you already have.

| Construct             | The question it answers                           |                                                 |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- |
| `<mix>`               | Which of several branches — in exact proportions? | [Choosing between values](mix.md)              |
| `<switch>`            | Which value follows from another field?           | [Lookup tables](switch.md)                     |
| `if`                  | Should this piece appear at all?                  | [Conditions](conditional-output.md)            |
| `repeat`              | How many values go in one cell?                   | [Several values in a cell](multiple-values.md) |
| `each`                | How many rows does one record produce?            | [One row per element](relational-tables.md)    |
| `uniq` · `<distinct>` | May a value repeat — in the row, or ever?         | [Uniqueness](unique-values.md)                 |

Three more things behave like constructs and are documented elsewhere, because they
belong to a bigger topic:

- **`<pool>`** — a row referencing a whole record instead of a value: thirty doctors,
  and a patient row that gets one of them entire. It grew into a topic of its own, with
  [its own section](../pools/overview.md).

- **`parent`** — a value drawn from the subset its parent selected. It's part of how
  sequences relate to one another, so it lives with
  [Sequences](../core-concepts/sequences.md); the applied side is in
  [Hierarchical dependencies](../guides/hierarchical-dependencies.md).
- **`<compute>`** — deriving a value by calculation instead of by drawing. It's a small
  language of its own, with [its own section](../compute/overview.md).

## Four of them in one config

Nothing here is contrived — this is what a config looks like once the constructs are
doing the work. A plan drawn in fixed proportions, a price that follows from the plan,
a variable number of tags in one cell, and a word that appears only on paid rows:

```xml
<env count="6" seed="tour">
  <mix name="Plan" percent="50,30,20">
    <case><gen type="text" value="free"/></case>
    <case><gen type="text" value="pro"/></case>
    <case><gen type="text" value="team"/></case>
  </mix>

  <switch name="Price" on="Plan">
    <map>free:0, pro:12, team:40</map>
  </switch>

  <sequence name="Tags">
    <gen type="text" value="api,web,cli,db" repeat="1..3" separator=";"/>
  </sequence>

  <sequence name="Id"><gen type="increment" value="1"/></sequence>
</env>

<block>
  <line>
    <data>${{Id}} ${{Plan}} $${{Price}} [${{Tags}}]</data>
    <data if="Price > 0"> paid</data>
  </line>
</block>
```

`./run tour.tdc`

```
1 free $0 [web;api]
2 free $0 [api;db;cli]
3 pro $12 [web] paid
4 free $0 [cli]
5 pro $12 [cli;api;db] paid
6 team $40 [db;web] paid
```

Read the output against the config and every construct is visible in it. Three of the six
rows are `free`, which is the `50` in `percent`. No `free` row carries `$12`, because
`Price` is derived from `Plan` rather than drawn on its own. The tag count changes from row
to row. And `paid` is missing on exactly the rows where the price is zero.

## Where to go next

Each page in this section covers one construct in full. Read them in order if you're
learning the language — they build on one another, and the examples get less trivial as
they go.

Once the constructs are familiar, the [Guides](../guides/hierarchical-dependencies.md)
show what to build with them: coherent records, CSV and SQL output, statistical shapes,
outliers, gaps, and datasets too big for memory.
