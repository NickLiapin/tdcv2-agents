# Relational tables with `each`

**Use it when** one record really stands for **several rows** — a customer with a
handful of orders, an invoice with line items, a post with tags — and you want them
as separate rows in a child table, each carrying a foreign key back to the parent,
all from a single config.

The [`each`](../reference/attributes.md) attribute repeats a
[`<line>`](../core-concepts/output-formatting.md) once per element of a list. One
record turns into **N output rows** — a normalized table ready for a database.

> [!NOTE]

*One run, four parents and their children, exactly as the rows come out.*

- **A** — the parent rows, each with its own key
- **B** — the child rows — every one of them carries its parent key, so nothing is orphaned

## At a glance

| Where      | What                                                                                   |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Applies on | [`<line>`](../core-concepts/output-formatting.md)                                     |
| Value      | The **name** of a sequence whose generator has [`repeat`](../reference/attributes.md) |
| Effect     | The line is emitted once per element of that list                                      |

The target sequence **must** carry [`repeat`](../reference/attributes.md) — that's
what makes it a list to iterate over. Point `each` at anything else and TDC tells you
why (see the last section below).

## The problem: a list crammed into one record

A customer placed three orders. On the record they sit as a list:

```
1;VIP;8648,7170,7063
```

That's no good for a database. You need an `orders` table where **each order is its
own row**, linked back to the customer. One record has to produce three rows — not one
row with a list in it.

## The tool

Give the orders their own [`repeat`](../reference/attributes.md) list, then put
`each` on the order line so it fires once per order:

```xml
<env count="4" seed="each-demo" inject="${{%}}">
    <sequence name="Id"><gen type="increment" value="1"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Name"><gen type="template" value="person.male.firstName"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Tier"><gen type="text" value="VIP,standard" percent="50,50"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="VipOrders" parent="Tier.VIP">
        <gen type="number" value="1000..9999" repeat="2..3"/>
    </sequence>
    <sequence name="StdOrders" parent="Tier.standard">
        <gen type="number" value="100..999" repeat="0..2"/>
    </sequence>
</env>
<block>
    <line><data>INSERT INTO customers VALUES (${{Id}}, '${{Name}}', '${{Tier}}');</data></line>
    <line each="VipOrders"><data>INSERT INTO orders VALUES (${{_item_id}}, ${{Id}}, ${{VipOrders}});</data></line>
    <line each="StdOrders"><data>INSERT INTO orders VALUES (${{_item_id}}, ${{Id}}, ${{StdOrders}});</data></line>
</block>
```

## What you get

`./run each-demo.tdc`

```
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (1, 'James', 'standard');
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (4, 1, 433);
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (5, 1, 474);
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (2, 'Michael', 'standard');
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (3, 'John', 'VIP');
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (11, 3, 2460);
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (12, 3, 5137);
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (13, 3, 7717);
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (4, 'Robert', 'VIP');
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (16, 4, 5249);
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (17, 4, 2324);
```

The order line is written **once** in the config, yet it prints as many times as the
customer has orders. Customer 2 (`Michael`) drew **zero** orders, so there are no
order rows for him at all and no empty placeholder left behind. The two `VIP`
customers draw from `VipOrders` and the standard customers from `StdOrders`, and each
row iterates the right list because
[`parent`](../guides/hierarchical-dependencies.md) already settled which list is
active.

**Why/when:** this is the one-config way to emit a parent table and its child table
together, correctly linked — no post-processing, no second run, no scripting to
explode the list.

## What's visible inside an `each` line

Inside a line that carries `each`, the iterated sequence name refers to the **current
element**, and two extra built-ins become available:

| Token            | What it means                                                                            |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `${{VipOrders}}` | the **current** element. Outside the `each` line, the same name is the whole joined list |
| `${{_item}}`     | position within the record: `1`, `2`, `3`                                                |
| `${{_item_id}}`  | a global, unique number across the whole run — your primary key                          |
| everything else  | as usual: `${{Id}}`, [`${{_count}}`](../reference/builtins.md), any other sequence      |

This is exactly why the foreign key works: `${{Id}}` still means the **customer** on
every order row, not the element. If iterating rebound `Id` to the element, every order
would point at the wrong customer. The parent's columns stay fixed; only the iterated
name and `_item` / `_item_id` advance.

## About the order numbers

Look at the primary keys: `4, 5`, then `11, 12, 13`, then `16, 17`. They **rise**, but
with gaps.

That's deliberate. `_item_id` is computed from the record's number, so a row can be
produced **without knowing its neighbors** — which is what keeps
[`--jobs`](../guides/large-outputs.md) parallelism byte-for-byte identical to a single-threaded
run. The price is a gap wherever a record has fewer orders than the maximum. For a primary
key that's perfectly fine — real databases rarely have gap-free IDs either.

Uniqueness is still ironclad, including across **multiple** lists — `StdOrders` uses
`4, 5` while `VipOrders` uses `11, 12, 13`, and the two ranges never collide. In a
larger check, 2000 records produced 3501 orders with 3501 distinct keys, and zero orders
pointing at a nonexistent customer.

**Why/when:** trust `_item_id` as a stable, unique, parallel-safe surrogate key.
Reach for `_item` instead when you want a per-record sequence number (`1, 2, 3` that
restarts on every parent).

## A lifecycle, not just a list

A record's rows do not have to be a bag of unrelated values. They can be a **history**:
an order that goes `created → paid → shipped → delivered`, one row per step, and never a
step out of sequence.

Two pieces do it. A [`<mix>`](mix.md) picks which path this order takes, and
[`if`](../core-concepts/output-formatting.md) on each `<line>` decides whether that step
belongs to the path — so the steps are written in the order they happen, and only the
lines of the chosen path fire:

```xml
<env count="20" seed="lifecycle" local="en">
    <sequence name="OrderId"><gen type="increment" value="1000"/></sequence>

    <mix name="Outcome" percent="60,25,15">
        <case><gen type="text" value="delivered"/></case>
        <case><gen type="text" value="refunded"/></case>
        <case><gen type="text" value="cancelled"/></case>
    </mix>
</env>
<block>
    <line><data>${{OrderId}},1,created</data></line>

    <line if="Outcome.delivered"><data>${{OrderId}},2,paid</data></line>
    <line if="Outcome.delivered"><data>${{OrderId}},3,shipped</data></line>
    <line if="Outcome.delivered"><data>${{OrderId}},4,delivered</data></line>

    <line if="Outcome.refunded"><data>${{OrderId}},2,paid</data></line>
    <line if="Outcome.refunded"><data>${{OrderId}},3,refunded</data></line>

    <line if="Outcome.cancelled"><data>${{OrderId}},2,cancelled</data></line>
</block>
```

`./run lifecycle.tdc`

```
1000,1,created
1000,2,paid
1000,3,shipped
1000,4,delivered
1001,1,created
1001,2,paid
1001,3,refunded
1002,1,created
1002,2,paid
1002,3,shipped
1002,4,delivered
1003,1,created
1003,2,paid
1003,3,shipped
1003,4,delivered
1004,1,created
1004,2,paid
1004,3,refunded
```

Every order takes a **legal** path — a shipped order was paid first, a cancelled one
never shipped — and the outcomes land in the exact proportions `<mix>` declared. The step
number is written into the line rather than counted, because the lines of one path are
known when the config is written.

**Why it is built this way.** A status column that changed by "looking at the previous
row" would force the run to be computed in order, from the first row. Choosing a whole
path up front and unrolling it keeps every record independent — so this works on the
streaming engines and in parallel, unchanged.

The same shape covers anything with a fixed vocabulary of steps: a support ticket
(`open → assigned → resolved`), a delivery, a moderation queue, an onboarding funnel.

## Where it won't work

`each` is strict about what it can iterate, and fails loudly rather than guessing:

| What                                                                     | Why                                                                                                         | Error    |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| `each` on a sequence with **no** [`repeat`](../reference/attributes.md) | there's nothing to iterate over                                                                             | `TDC207` |
| `each` on a name that doesn't exist                                      | the sequence is undeclared                                                                                  | `TDC206` |
| `<data name="…">` inside an `each` line                                  | a named `<data>` is a **column** for Parquet, and Parquet collects columns per record, not per iterated row | `TDC209` |

`./run broken.tdc  (each on a non-list)`

```
error[TDC207]: each="Tier" — that sequence holds one value, not a list
note: Add repeat= to its <gen>, e.g. <gen … repeat="1..5"/>, or drop each=.
```

For **Parquet** output you don't need `each` at all: a
[`repeat`](../reference/attributes.md) list stays a real list inside the column,
which is already the right shape for a columnar file. `each` is the tool for **text**
formats — SQL, CSV, JSON lines — where one record must become several physical rows.
