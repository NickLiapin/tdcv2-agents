# `<assert>` — a config that checks its own output

**Use it when** the shape of your data matters to whoever consumes it, and you want the
run to stop rather than hand over a file that quietly drifted.

An assertion states a property the finished run must have. If it holds, nothing happens.
If it doesn't, the run stops with your own sentence, before a single line is written.

```xml
<assert that="Tracked == 700" says="every shipped order should carry a tracking number"/>
```

It lives in `<env>`, beside [`<uniq>` and `<distinct>`](unique-values.md), because like
them it states something the whole run must satisfy rather than something one column is.

There are two of them. `that=` is read **once**, over whole-run numbers. `each=` is
answered on **every row** — see [Every row](#every-row--each) below.

## What is worth asserting

Not what the config already states. You wrote `percent="70"` and you assert 70 percent —
you have tested that TDC can count.

The value is in what the config does **not** state. Here a filter and a condition stack
up, and the share that reaches the file is nowhere in the text:

```xml
<tdc>
  <env count="1000" seed="orders" local="en">
    <sequence name="Status"><gen type="text" value="shipped,pending" percent="70,30"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Tracking" parent="Status.shipped">
      <gen type="regex" value="[A-Z]{2}[0-9]{9}" if="Status == 'shipped' && _count % 4 != 0"/>
    </sequence>
    <sequence name="Tracked"><gen type="stat" of="Tracking" op="count"/></sequence>

    <assert that="Tracked == 700" says="every shipped order should carry a tracking number"/>
  </env>
  <block>
    <line><data>${{Status}},${{Tracking}}</data></line>
  </block>
</tdc>
```

`./run orders.tdc`

```
tdcv2: assert failed: every shipped order should carry a tracking number
  Tracked == 700   with Tracked = 522
```

Nothing else in TDC has an opinion about this config. It parses, it validates, it runs,
and 178 shipped orders come out with an empty tracking number. That is the failure an
assertion is for.

The exit code is 1, so CI stops on it.

## At a glance

| Attribute | Required   | What it does                                                                        |
| :-------- | :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `that`    | one of two | A condition over whole-run values, read once, in the [`if=`](../reference/expressions.md) language |
| `each`    | one of two | A condition every row must satisfy, in the same language                             |
| `says`    | yes        | The sentence a reader is given when it fails                                         |

`says=` is required either way. An assertion that fires with only its expression to show
has made the reader work out what it was for, months later, in a CI log. `that=` and
`each=` cannot be written on one tag: they are checked a different number of times, and a
reader could not tell which of the two the sentence describes.

There is **no flag**. An assertion runs because it is written: a check that has to be
remembered is a check nobody ran, on a config that looks verified.

## Where the numbers come from

`that=` reads columns, and the columns worth reading are usually
[`<gen type="stat">`](../generators/stat.md) — one number for the whole run.

```xml
<env count="500" seed="clinic" local="en">
    <sequence name="Visit"><gen type="date" from="2026-01-01" to="2026-06-30" format="YYYY-MM-DD"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Follow"><gen type="date" of="Visit" plus="7..30d" format="YYYY-MM-DD"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Ward"><gen type="text" value="A,B,C" percent="50,30,20"/></sequence>

    <sequence name="Rows"><gen type="stat" of="Visit" op="count"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Wards"><gen type="stat" of="Ward" op="count"/></sequence>

    <assert that="Rows == _total" says="every row has a visit date"/>
    <assert that="Wards == _total" says="every row has a ward"/>
</env>
```

`_total` is the row count, and it is the one built-in an assertion may read.

## The rule that keeps it honest

**Every name in `that=` must be the same on every row.** A `stat` column is, by
construction. A one-value `text` column is, as a matter of fact. A drawn column is not,
and is refused:

```xml
<sequence name="Amount"><gen type="number" value="1..500"/></sequence>
<assert that="Amount > 0" says="every amount is positive"/>
```

`./run amounts.tdc`

```
tdcv2: assert ("Amount > 0"): "Amount" is not the same on every row, so this would have checked the first row and called the run verified. A whole-run assertion reads whole-run values: give it a <gen type="stat" of="Amount" op="…"/> column, or _total. To state it of every row instead, write each= rather than that=.
```

Without this rule, `that="Amount > 0"` would read row 0 and report on one row out of five
hundred — a check that passed because it barely looked, wearing a badge that says
verified. That is the same disease the whole feature exists to cure.

A column that a `parent=` filter leaves **empty** on some rows is refused for the same
reason: it has no single value for the run, so the condition would compare against
whatever row 0 happened to hold. Summarise it with `op="count"` instead.

## Every row — `each=`

The refusal above is not a dead end; it is a signpost. "Every amount is positive" is a
real claim, and `each=` is where it goes:

```xml
<sequence name="Amount"><gen type="number" value="1..500"/></sequence>
<assert each="Amount > 0" says="every amount is positive"/>
```

The condition is answered on every row, in the same language `if=` speaks and over the
same names — this row's columns, plus the row
[built-ins](../reference/builtins.md). Nothing new to learn, and no `stat` column to
build first.

When a row breaks it, the run stops **on that row** and says which:

```xml
<sequence name="Fee"><gen type="number" value="-3..20"/></sequence>
<assert each="Fee >= 0" says="a fee is never negative"/>
```

`./run fees.tdc (20 rows)`

```
tdcv2: assert failed on row 16: a fee is never negative
  Fee >= 0   with Fee = -3
```

The exit code is 1, as with `that=`.

**It stops at the first failing row rather than counting them all.** On a streaming engine
the rows before it are already on disk, so "checks the whole file, then reports" is
something not every engine could honestly promise — and a run whose data is already wrong
is not made righter by finding out how wrong. The row it names is the first, always: rows
are checked in order, before each one is written.

**It holds however the rows are read, not only as text.** A program that takes the rows as
objects gets the same refusal: `toArray()` and `toColumns()` check every row, `iterate()`
checks each row just before handing it over, and `getAt(i)` checks the row it returns.
Every library does the same under its own spelling (`to_array`, `ToArray`…). In Rust the
whole run is made when the object is created, so there the refusal arrives at creation.

That last point is why a config with an `each=` assertion **runs on one thread**. Workers
each own a range of rows and would each stop at their own first failure, so the row a
reader is shown would be whichever thread got there — a different number from the same
config and the same seed. An explicit `--jobs` says so and carries on single-threaded.

Otherwise there is no engine consequence: unlike `that=`, a per-row assertion needs no
`stat` column, so a config with one still streams. See
[large outputs](../guides/large-outputs.md).

## What it does not do yet

- **Asserting a check digit.** That is the trap — [`<compute>`](../compute/overview.md)
  produced it, and recomputing it asserts that the same code agrees with itself.

## Engines

A `that=` assertion reads `stat` columns, and `stat` already routes a config to the
in-memory engine — so it adds no engine consequence of its own. An `each=` assertion adds
none either, beyond staying single-threaded. See
[large outputs](../guides/large-outputs.md).
