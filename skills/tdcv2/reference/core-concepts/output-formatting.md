# Output & formatting

Once you've declared your data as [sequences](sequences.md), the **output block** turns
it into text in whatever shape you want: CSV, JSON, SQL, a log line, a config file. It's
three nested tags — `<block>` → `<line>` → `<data>` — plus interpolation and a few
optional pieces (fixtures, filters, conditions).

> [!NOTE]
> The example outputs below are illustrative — the exact values can differ by core version
> and seed. What matters is the **shape** of each transformation, not the specific names
> or numbers.

*The output in the order it's printed, top to bottom, for a run of two records.*

- **A** — printed once, at the very start
- **B** — before every record
- **C** — a line of the record
- **D** — between the lines of one record — never after the last line
- **E** — after every record
- **F** — between records — never after the last record
- **G** — printed once, at the very end
- **H** — everything inside the bracket repeats once per record

## The output block: `<block>` → `<line>` → `<data>`

- **[`<block>`](#block--the-record-layout)** describes the layout of **one record**. The
  renderer repeats it `count` times — once per record — substituting fresh sequence
  values on each pass.
- **[`<line>`](#line--one-line-of-a-record)** is one line of output inside a record.
  Every `<line>` is followed by a newline.
- **[`<data>`](#data--raw-text)** holds **raw text**: everything between `<data>` and
  `</data>` is printed as-is, with one exception — interpolation `${{…}}`, which is
  replaced by sequence values.

A record can span several lines. You describe them once and the block repeats:

```xml
<tdc>
    <env count="2" seed="demo">
        <sequence name="Person">
            <gen name="Name" type="text" value="Alice,Bob,Carol"/>
            <gen name="Age" type="number" value="20..40"/>
        </sequence>
    </env>
    <block>
        <line><data>name=${{Person.Name}}</data></line>
        <line><data>age=${{Person.Age}}</data></line>
    </block>
</tdc>
```

`./run demo.tdc (count=2)`

```
name=Bob
age=30
name=Alice
age=28
```

The two-line block rendered twice (`count="2"`) — two records of two lines apiece, each
with its own `Name` and `Age`.

## `<block>` — the record layout

`<block>` is the one **required** child of [`<tdc>`](../reference/tags.md). It has no
attributes. Its only job is to hold the lines of a single record, which the renderer
repeats `count` times.

The only child it allows is `<line>`. A stray tag directly inside `<block>` is an error,
not a silent skip — that catches a misplaced [`<gen>`](../generators/overview.md) or a
mistyped tag before it corrupts your output:

`./run demo.tdc`

```
error[TDC013]: <foo> is not allowed directly inside <block>
```

If [`<before_block>`](#fixtures--text-around-the-records) /
[`<after_block>`](#fixtures--text-around-the-records) /
[`<delimiter_block>`](#fixtures--text-around-the-records) are declared in `<env>`, they
wrap each rendered record — see [Fixtures](#fixtures--text-around-the-records) below.

## `<line>` — one line of a record

`<line>` describes a single line inside a record. It's emitted once per pass, with a
trailing newline, and it holds any number of `<data>` children, printed one after
another from left to right.

### `if` — show the whole line only on a condition

**Problem.** You want a `---` separator **between** records, but not dangling after the
last one. Guard the whole line with `if`: when the expression is false, neither the line
**nor** its inter-line delimiter is emitted on that pass.

```xml
<tdc>
    <env count="3" seed="demo">
        <sequence name="Name">
            <gen type="text" value="Alice,Bob,Carol" order="sequential"/>
        </sequence>
    </env>
    <block>
        <line><data>name=${{Name}}</data></line>
        <line if="!_last"><data>---</data></line>
    </block>
</tdc>
```

`./run demo.tdc (count=3)`

```
name=Alice
---
name=Bob
---
name=Carol
```

The second line prints on every record **except the last** (`_last` is the built-in
"this is the final record" flag) — exactly the "between, but not at the end" behavior
you also get from the [`<delimiter_block>`](#fixtures--text-around-the-records) fixture.
The `if` expression uses the same small language as
[`<data if>`](#conditional-text-with-if): comparisons, `!`, `&&`, `||`, and the built-in
names.

### `comment` — a note that never renders

`<line comment="…">` carries a free-form note for whoever maintains the config. It's
ignored at render time and never reaches the output. Use it to annotate a complicated
layout.

### Generators don't live in `<line>`

The output block is for **formatting only**. You can't put a `<gen>` or a `<mix>`
directly in a `<line>` — declare a named [`<sequence>`](sequences.md) (or a
[`<mix>`](../reference/tags.md)) in [`<env>`](configuration.md) and reference it with
`${{Name}}`. This keeps _what the data is_ separate from _how it's laid out_.

There's a related limit: an [`advanced_regex`](../generators/advanced-regex.md)
generator used from inside the output can't use the weighted-choice form `(?%{...})`,
because exact percentages need a sequence context with a known `count`. Declare it as a
named sequence in `<env>` instead.

## `<data>` — raw text

`<data>` holds **raw text**. Everything between the opening `<data>` and its `</data>`
is printed verbatim, with a single exception: interpolation `${{…}}` is replaced by
sequence values.

`<data>` is the **only** place you can freely write `<`, `>`, `{`, `}`, quotes, and
commas — the characters that are special to XML. That's what lets you assemble JSON,
CSV, SQL, or any other format built out of those characters:

```xml
<line><data><tag> = "value", {key: 42}</data></line>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
<tag> = "value", {key: 42}
```

Two things to know about the raw text:

- **XML entities are not expanded.** `&lt;` stays the literal `&lt;`; it does **not**
  turn into `<`. Just write the character you actually want.
- **In the layout, `<data>` lives inside a `<line>`** — either the block's lines or a
  fixture's — and nowhere else. Here it takes two optional attributes:
  [`if`](#conditional-text-with-if) (suppress this piece on a condition) and
  [`pair`](#raw-text-and-a-literal-data) (for a literal `</data>` in the text).
  The same tag has a second, unrelated job inside `<env>`: as a child of a
  [`<sequence>`](sequences.md#a-composed-sequence) it is literal text glued into a
  composed value, and with a `name` it is a
  [constant field](sequences.md#a-constant-field). Layout or value — the surrounding tag
  decides.

### Spaces are text too — indentation comes free

"Verbatim" includes **spaces**. Leading ones, trailing ones, and long runs in the middle
all reach the output exactly as you typed them:

```xml
<line><data>      hello   </data><data>|end</data></line>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
      hello   |end
```

Nothing is trimmed and nothing is collapsed, so **you indent the output by indenting the
text inside `<data>`**. That's the whole technique for producing structured, readable
files — an indented SQL schema, nested JSON, YAML, a tree.

Keep the two kinds of indentation straight. The indentation of the **tags** (`<line>`
sitting two spaces in) is your config's own layout, and it never shows up in the output.
Only what sits _between_ `<data>` and `</data>` is text. In the schema below, the two
spaces before `id` are inside the data and survive; the four before `<line>` are outside
it and disappear:

```xml
<env count="2" seed="indent">
  <before>
    <line><data>CREATE TABLE customers (</data></line>
    <line><data>  id    INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,</data></line>
    <line><data>  name  TEXT NOT NULL,</data></line>
    <line><data>  city  TEXT NOT NULL</data></line>
    <line><data>);</data></line>
  </before>
  <sequence name="Id"><gen type="increment" value="1"/></sequence>
  <sequence name="Name"><gen type="template" value="person.male.firstName"/></sequence>
  <sequence name="City"><gen type="text" value="Paris,Berlin"/></sequence>
</env>
<block>
  <line><data>INSERT INTO customers VALUES (${{Id}}, '${{Name}}', '${{City}}');</data></line>
</block>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id    INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name  TEXT NOT NULL,
  city  TEXT NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (1, 'James', 'Berlin');
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (2, 'John', 'Paris');
```

The extra spaces after `id` and `name` are doing alignment work — nothing lines the
columns up for you, you type the padding yourself. The same trick gives you indented
JSON: put `  {` on one line and `    "id": ${{Id}},` on the next, and the nesting is
the spaces you wrote.

> [!NOTE]
> **Attributes behave the opposite way**
>
> A `<data>` body is never trimmed; a comma-separated attribute list **is**. In
> `value="a, b"` the second item is `b`, not `" b"` — the space around the comma is
> separator padding, not data. So inside `<data>` the spaces are yours to control, and
> inside a `value=` list they're cleaned up for you. The flip side of "never trimmed":
> a trailing space you can't see is still in the file.

## Interpolation — `${{Name}}`

Inside `<data>`, `${{Name}}` is replaced by that sequence's value on the current row.

```xml
<block>
    <line><data>Name: ${{Name}}, age: ${{Age}}</data></line>
</block>
```

`./run demo.tdc (Name = person name, Age = 18..80)`

```
Name: James, age: 72
Name: Mary, age: 18
Name: Andrew, age: 64
Name: Emma, age: 26
```

### How a name resolves

For each `${{Name}}`:

1. **A declared sequence with a value on this row** → that value.
2. **A declared sequence with no value on this row** (filtered out on this pass by a
   [`parent`](../guides/hierarchical-dependencies.md)) → the **empty string**.
3. **An undeclared name** (a typo, a forgotten declaration) → error `TDC193`, with a
   suggestion:

`./run typo.tdc`

```
error[TDC193]: "Nmae" is not a declared sequence — it would be printed literally
help: did you mean "Name"?
```

This check earns its keep in typed output. In a CSV you might spot a stray `${{Nmae}}`
by eye, but in a Parquet file it would land in a typed string column and look like a
real value — you'd never catch it. If you genuinely want a literal `${{...}}` in the
output (you're generating a config, a GitHub Actions file, a Handlebars template),
change the marker with [`inject`](#a-custom-interpolation-marker) and the check turns
off.

### Built-in names

Always available without declaring anything: `${{_count}}` (1-based record number),
`${{_first}}` / `${{_last}}` (`"true"` / `"false"`), and `${{_total}}` (the total). See
[Built-ins](../reference/builtins.md).

### Filters

You can transform a value in place with a `|` "pipe" — a mask, a case change, a slice,
and so on. This is formatting **on the way out**: the value is generated as usual, and
then the filter reshapes it. Here a raw nine-digit US SSN gets a display mask:

```xml
<data>${{Ssn}}  ->  ${{Ssn | mask:xxx-xx-xxxx}}</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
407963258  ->  407-96-3258
539027461  ->  539-02-7461
```

Filters chain left to right (`${{Name | mask:w:w | upper}}` — mask, then uppercase).
The full set — `mask`, `upper`/`lower`/`capitalize`/`title`, `slice`, `replace`,
`trim`, `group`, `compact`, and the `csv`/`sql` escapes — is in
**[Masks & case](../guides/masks-and-case.md)**.

### Where interpolation does _not_ run

- **Not in attributes.** Interpolation happens only in `<data>` text, never inside a
  tag's attribute value.
- **No nesting.** Interpolation is single-pass. If a sequence value itself contains
  `${{Something}}`, that inner marker is **not** processed again — it goes out as-is.

Fixtures are the one place people expect it not to reach, and it does: see
[Fixtures](#fixtures--text-around-the-records) below.

## Conditional text with `if`

`<data if="…">` prints only when the expression is true. If the condition is false, that
one `<data>` is suppressed for the row, and any other `<data>` in the same `<line>`
still renders normally. The classic use is "JSON without a trailing comma": a second
`<data if="!_last">,` prints a comma on every record but the last.

```xml
<tdc>
    <env count="3" seed="demo">
        <before><line><data>[</data></line></before>
        <after><line><data>]</data></line></after>
        <sequence name="Id"><gen type="increment" value="1"/></sequence>
    </env>
    <block>
        <line><data>  {"id": ${{Id}}}</data><data if="!_last">,</data></line>
    </block>
</tdc>
```

`./run demo.tdc (count=3)`

```
[
  {"id": 1},
  {"id": 2},
  {"id": 3}
]
```

Two `<data>` tags in one `<line>` print back to back: the object, then the comma. On the
last record `!_last` is false, the comma is skipped, and the JSON stays valid. The
expression language supports comparisons (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`), the boolean operators
`!`, `&&`, and `||`, and the built-in names — it's the same language
[`<line if>`](#if--show-the-whole-line-only-on-a-condition) uses.

## Fixtures — text around the records

Fixtures print fixed text at the edges of the run, which keeps the per-record `<block>`
clean:

- **`<before>`** and **`<after>`** print **once** — before the first record and after
  the last. Typical uses: the opening `[` and closing `]` of a JSON array, a CSV header
  row, an `INSERT INTO … VALUES` prefix, a trailing `;`.
- **`<before_block>`**, **`<after_block>`**, and **`<delimiter_block>`** wrap **each**
  record. The last of the three prints between records but not after the final one.

All fixtures live inside [`<env>`](configuration.md) and, like the block, hold
`<line>` → `<data>`. The `[` and `]` in the JSON example above are a `<before>` and an
`<after>`:

```xml
<tdc>
    <env count="3" seed="demo">
        <before><line><data>[</data></line></before>
        <after><line><data>]</data></line></after>
        <sequence name="Id"><gen type="increment" value="1"/></sequence>
    </env>
    <block>
        <line><data>  ${{Id}}</data></line>
    </block>
</tdc>
```

`./run demo.tdc (count=3)`

```
[
  1
  2
  3
]
```

The `[` printed exactly once at the top and the `]` exactly once at the bottom, whether
`count` is 3 or 3,000.

Two caveats, both enforced:

- **Interpolation DOES run in fixtures.** A `${{Name}}` reads the row the fixture stands
  beside: `<before>` sees the first row, `<after>` the last, and the per-card and per-line
  fixtures the row they wrap. That is what lets a record put its own fields around a nested
  list. (This is one of the few behaviours the reference implementation had to be corrected
  on: it printed the braces literally while all four ports expanded them.)
- **Generators don't run in fixtures either.** A `<gen>`, `<mix>`, or `<switch>` inside
  a fixture is error `TDC131`. This used to fail silently: a `value="500..999"`
  generator in a fixture always emitted `500`, the low bound, which looked like a real
  value.

## A custom interpolation marker

[`inject`](../reference/attributes.md) on [`<env>`](configuration.md) changes the
interpolation markers. The `%` is where the name goes, and it needs an opening and a
closing part around it — TDC splits the pattern at the **rightmost** `%` that leaves both
sides non-empty, which is what lets `%` itself appear in the wrapper:

```xml
<env inject="${{%}}">…</env>   <!-- the default -->
<env inject="[%]">…</env>       <!-- then write [Name] in <data> -->
<env inject="%{%}%">…</env>     <!-- split at the middle %: write %{Name}% -->
```

With `inject="[%]"` and `<data>Name: [Name]</data>`:

`./run demo.tdc (inject=[%])`

```
Name: James
Name: Mary
Name: Andrew
Name: Emma
```

Only the substitution **syntax** changes, not the data — the values are identical to the
default `${{Name}}` form. The prefix and suffix are escaped for you, even when they
contain regex metacharacters. The main reason to change the marker is to emit a literal
`${{...}}` in your output (a config, a template) without tripping the undeclared-name
check.

## Raw text and a literal `</data>`

`<data>` is raw, but a plain `<data>` closes at the **first** `</data>` it hits. To emit
a literal `</data>` in the text — a snippet of TDC syntax in generated documentation,
say — give the tag a [`pair`](../reference/attributes.md) marker; the opening and
closing tags both have to carry the same one. In the example below the `${{...}}` is
meant to appear verbatim too, so it also moves the
[interpolation marker](configuration.md) out of the way with `inject`:

```xml
<env count="1" seed="demo" inject="[[%]]">
    <sequence name="Name"><gen type="text" value="a,b"/></sequence>
</env>
<block>
    <line><data pair="doc-example">To print a name, write: <data>${{Name}}</data></data pair="doc-example"></line>
</block>
```

```
To print a name, write: <data>${{Name}}</data>
```

The `pair` value has to be unique within the file. The parser now knows that only
`</data pair="doc-example">` closes the block, so the inner `</data>` comes through as
plain text. (Without the `inject="[[%]]"`, `${{Name}}` would still be interpolated into
a value — `pair` protects the tags, not the substitution markers.)
