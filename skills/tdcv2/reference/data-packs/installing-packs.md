# Installing packs: `init` and `pack`

Names, cities, states, companies, and other lists are [**data packs**](overview.md).
They ship **separately from the engine**, so updating the library never overwrites your
data, and heavy sets don't bloat every install. A sensible default set is bundled (the
top 1000 first names, for instance); the full and extra sets are fetched on demand with
`tdcv2 pack`.

The whole flow is two commands, and the order matters:

1. `tdcv2 init` **once per project** — decide **where** downloaded data lives.
2. `tdcv2 pack add …` — fill that place with the sets you actually need.

`init` comes first because it answers a question `pack` cannot: which folder is
_yours_. Packs deliberately do not live inside the installed library — if they did,
every `npm update`, `pip install -U` or dependency bump would wipe a gigabyte of data
you chose. `init` writes down a folder that belongs to your project, and every
implementation reads that same file, so a pack downloaded once is found by all of them.

Skip `init` and `pack` has nowhere to put anything, and says so rather than guessing:

`tdcv2 pack list (no config yet)`

```
tdcv2: no pack store configured — run `tdcv2 init` first
```

## `tdcv2 init` — set up a project

`init` writes a config file so you never have to hand-edit JSON. In an interactive
terminal it runs a short wizard: where to store the config, where to download packs,
which locale is the default. In a script or in CI, pass flags instead so nothing blocks
on a prompt.

A **project** init also writes three runnable examples into a new `tdcv2-examples/`
folder — worth knowing before running it inside an existing repository.
[`--global`](#--global---g--one-config-for-every-project) writes none.

```bash
tdcv2 init            # ask, then write
```

`tdcv2 init`

```
Wrote project config: /path/to/project/tdcv2.config.json
  data packs → /path/to/project/tdcv2-packs
  locale     → en
  examples   → tdcv2-examples/01-starter.tdc, tdcv2-examples/02-any-format.tdc, tdcv2-examples/03-coherent-records.tdc

Next: run it.
    tdcv2 tdcv2-examples/01-starter.tdc

The common, en and USA packs are already inside this install, so the
examples run with nothing downloaded. `tdcv2 pack` adds more locales.
```

Use it once per project, before your first `tdcv2 pack add`. Each flag below covers a
case where the wizard would get in your way.

### `--yes` / `-y` — no questions

Skips every prompt and accepts the defaults (project-local config, `./tdcv2-packs`,
`en`). This is the flag for CI and scripts, where nobody is around to answer the
wizard's questions.

```bash
tdcv2 init --yes
```

`tdcv2 init --yes`

```
Wrote project config: /path/to/project/tdcv2.config.json
  data packs → /path/to/project/tdcv2-packs
  locale     → en
  examples   → tdcv2-examples/01-starter.tdc, tdcv2-examples/02-any-format.tdc, tdcv2-examples/03-coherent-records.tdc

Next: run it.
    tdcv2 tdcv2-examples/01-starter.tdc

The common, en and USA packs are already inside this install, so the
examples run with nothing downloaded. `tdcv2 pack` adds more locales.
```

### `--global` / `-g` — one config for every project

Writes the config into your user config directory instead of the current folder:

| Platform                    | Where it goes                                          |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows                     | `%APPDATA%\tdcv2\config.json` (`~/AppData/Roaming/…` if `%APPDATA%` is unset) |
| POSIX, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` set | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tdcv2/config.json`                   |
| POSIX, default              | `~/.config/tdcv2/config.json`                          |
 Use it when you want one shared data store that every project on the machine
reads from, rather than a separate `tdcv2-packs` folder in each repo.

```bash
tdcv2 init --global
```

`tdcv2 init --global`

```
Wrote global config: /Users/you/.config/tdcv2/config.json
  data packs → /Users/you/.config/tdcv2/packs
  locale     → en
```

### `--force` / `-f` — overwrite an existing config

By default, `init` refuses to clobber a config that already exists. Pass `--force` when
you deliberately want to reset it — to change the pack folder, say, or to start clean.

`tdcv2 init (config already exists)`

```
Config already exists: /path/to/project/tdcv2.config.json
Nothing written. Re-run with --force to overwrite.
```

### `--locale <loc>` — pick the default locale

Sets the `locale` value in the config, so you don't have to name a locale on every run.
`en` is the built-in default; pass another code to make that one the project default.

```bash
tdcv2 init --yes --locale en
```

### `--data-path <dir>` — pick the pack folder

Sets where `pack add` downloads to (the `packStore`, below). Point it at a shared drive
or at a path outside the repo when you don't want packs living next to your source.

```bash
tdcv2 init --yes --data-path ../shared-tdc-packs
```

## The `tdcv2.config.json` file

`init` writes a small file like this:

```json
{
  "packStore": "./tdcv2-packs",
  "locale": "en"
}
```

- **`packStore`** — where `pack` downloads to. Every set lands in that one folder, and
  the first `pack add` registers the folder itself in `dataPaths`. See
  [inside the pack store](#inside-the-pack-store) for what it looks like.
- **`locale`** — the default locale (set by the `--locale` flag, above).
- **`dataPaths`** — the folders the engine actually scans for packs. `pack add` puts the
  store in there for you, and you can add your own folders here to point the engine at
  [packs you wrote yourself](writing-your-own.md).

A run finds its config by walking **up from the `.tdc` file's own folder**, the same way
tools locate `tsconfig.json` — so `tdcv2 sub/users.tdc` picks up `sub/`'s project config,
not the shell's. `tdcv2 pack` and `tdcv2 init` have no `.tdc` file to start from, so those
two walk up from the current folder instead. When several sources define the same setting, priority runs low to high:

```
built-in packs  <  global config (~/.config/tdcv2)  <  project tdcv2.config.json  <  --data-path flag
```

Paths inside the file are resolved **relative to the file itself**, not to your current
working directory, so a config can travel with its project.

## `tdcv2 pack` — download and remove sets

Run with no arguments in a terminal, `pack` opens a **picker** rather than printing the
catalogue at you. 294 bundles do not fit on a screen, so they are browsed the way they
are shaped:

- **Everything**, or **choose what I need** — the first question, before anything else.
- Languages in one list; countries reached **through a continent**, off a map.
- `/` searches from anywhere: type `braz` and Brazil is there, labelled with its continent.
- <kbd>space</kbd> picks, and on a continent it takes **the whole continent** at once.
- <kbd>backspace</kbd>, <kbd>esc</kbd> or <kbd>←</kbd> steps back out of any screen.
- **Review** lists the basket with its total size; <kbd>space</kbd> drops anything you
  changed your mind about, <kbd>enter</kbd> applies. Nothing downloads before that.

The map shows what you have taken so far: the continent under the cursor lights up, and
each picked country burns a spark where it actually is. Press <kbd>m</kbd> to switch
between bare coastlines and filled land.

Every implementation opens the same picker, and the terminal decides how it is drawn:
half-blocks and colour where they exist, ASCII and a plain line drawing where they do not
(the old Windows console, a pipe, `NO_COLOR`). Java's and Rust's pickers need `stty` and
so are Unix-only; on Windows they print the list instead, which Node, Python and C# do not
have to because their runtimes read a keystroke on their own.

In a script — or anywhere without a terminal — drive it with subcommands:

```bash
tdcv2 pack list              # what's in the registry
tdcv2 pack add en usa        # download and wire up
tdcv2 pack remove usa        # remove
```

Every subcommand also takes **`--registry <base-url>`**, which points `pack` at a
catalog other than the public one. The default is the project's own registry:

```bash
tdcv2 pack list --registry https://packs.example.internal/tdc
tdcv2 pack add en --registry=https://packs.example.internal/tdc
```

Use it for a company mirror or an air-gapped copy. The URL is a base — `pack` appends
the index and archive paths itself — and a trailing slash is ignored. The `sha256`
check still runs, so a mirror that serves altered bytes fails to install, the same way
the public registry would.

### `pack list` — see the catalog

Prints the registry, marks what you already have installed, and shows the download size
of each set.

`tdcv2 pack list`

```
Available data packs:

common ✓ installed Common (locale-agnostic) (46.5 KB)
Generators bound to neither a language nor a country: uuid,
hashes, ISBN/ISSN, GTIN/UPC/EAN, card PANs, MRZ, IPv4/IPv6/MAC,
semver, and more.

ar Arabic (language) (88.8 KB)
Content bound to the Arabic language rather than to any one
country: address, airline, animal, book, clothing, color,
commerce, company, date, education, event, finance, and 23 more.

…

yemen Yemen (country) (2.9 KB)
Data specific to Yemen: docs, education, finance, geo, holiday,
phone, sport.

Install with: tdcv2 pack add <id>
```

Descriptions are folded to your window, so the list stays a list however narrow the
terminal is. Piped or redirected there is no window to measure, and all five
implementations assume 80 columns — so a saved listing is the same file whichever one
wrote it.

The catalogue holds **294 sets today**: `common`, 95 languages, and 198 countries. A
language or country that is not listed is not finished — an entry is a promise that every
address under it resolves, so a folder holding one file does not get one.

Use it to check what an address needs before you generate, and to confirm that a set
landed after `pack add`.

### `pack add <id…>` — download and register

`pack add` downloads the set's zip, verifies its `sha256` (a tampered or corrupted
download won't install), unpacks it into the pack store, and **registers** that store in
your config, so the data is live at its dotted addresses right away — no extra wiring
step.

```bash
tdcv2 pack add en
```

`tdcv2 pack add en`

```
Installed en: 324 files → /path/to/project/tdcv2-packs/en
  registered ./tdcv2-packs in /path/to/project/tdcv2.config.json
```

The store is registered once, on the first install. Later sets land in the same folder
and say `already registered` instead.

You can install several sets in one call — `tdcv2 pack add common en usa` — and that's
the normal way to assemble a locale (see [axis-pure packs](#packs-are-axis-pure) below).

### `pack remove <id…>` — delete and unregister

`pack remove` deletes exactly the paths that set brought, and nothing beside them. A
folder left empty by the deletion goes too.

```bash
tdcv2 pack remove usa
```

`tdcv2 pack remove usa`

```
Removed usa (/path/to/project/tdcv2-packs/countries/usa)
```

The store stays in `dataPaths` while it still holds something, because that one entry
serves every set in it. Remove the last set and the entry goes as well:

`tdcv2 pack remove common en`

```
Removed common (/path/to/project/tdcv2-packs/common)
Removed en (/path/to/project/tdcv2-packs/en)
  store now empty — unregistered /path/to/project/tdcv2-packs from /path/to/project/tdcv2.config.json
```

Removing a set is safe: the [built-in default](#built-in-default-vs-downloaded) at those
addresses comes back on its own.

### Behind a proxy

`pack list` and `pack add` reach the registry through the proxy the environment names,
as npm and curl do — which matters on a corporate network, a CI runner or an agent's
sandbox, where a proxy is the only way out:

- an `https` address uses the first of `https_proxy`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `all_proxy`,
  `ALL_PROXY` that is set; an `http` one `http_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `all_proxy`,
  `ALL_PROXY`;
- `NO_PROXY` (or `no_proxy`) lists the hosts that go direct, comma-separated: an entry
  matches the host itself and everything under it (`example.com` and `.example.com`
  both cover `raw.example.com`), and `*` sends everything direct;
- a value written without a scheme is an `http://` proxy; a user and password in it
  (`http://user:pass@proxy:8080`) are sent to the proxy and never printed.

When the registry cannot be reached, the message names the address, the proxy it went
through and the variable that chose it, and what the network answered:

```text
tdcv2: cannot reach https://raw.githubusercontent.com/…/index.json through the proxy http://127.0.0.1:9 from HTTPS_PROXY (connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:9)
```

## Inside the pack store

Every set unpacks into the **one** folder `packStore` names. A language goes under its
code, a country under `countries/`, and `common` under its own name:

```text
tdcv2-packs/
├── .tdcv2-installed.json
├── common/…
├── en/…
└── countries/usa/…
```

That folder is a single scan root, so the config holds one `dataPaths` entry however many
sets you install:

```json
{
  "packStore": "./tdcv2-packs",
  "locale": "en",
  "dataPaths": ["./tdcv2-packs"]
}
```

`.tdcv2-installed.json` is the store's own bookkeeping, and not a file you edit. For each
set it records the paths that set owns, how many files it brought, the `sha256` the
download was checked against, and the version if the registry publishes one. That is what
`pack remove` reads to find what to delete, and what `pack list` reads for the
`✓ installed` mark.

### A store from an earlier version

Earlier versions unpacked each set into `<store>/<id>/packs/…` and gave it a `dataPaths`
entry of its own. That put three near-identical levels on disk, and it put one entry per
set in the config — a hundred country packs meant a hundred entries.

The first `tdcv2 pack` command of any kind moves such a store to the layout above, in
place. Nothing is downloaded again. The notice goes to stderr:

`tdcv2 pack list (store in the old layout)`

```
tdcv2: pack store "/path/to/project/tdcv2-packs" used the old per-bundle layout; moved it to the flat one.
  en: en/packs → en (324 files)
  usa: usa/packs → countries/usa (22 files)
  dropped 2 per-bundle dataPaths entries
  registered ./tdcv2-packs instead
```

Every move is planned before anything moves. If a path in the new layout is already
taken, the whole migration is refused and the collisions are named, rather than leaving
the store half in one shape and half in the other.

## Packs are axis-pure

Packs are organized along a **single axis** — a language, a country, or the
locale-agnostic `common` set — and they **compose**. US English data isn't one
monolithic pack; it's three layers stacked on top of each other:

```bash
tdcv2 pack add common en usa
```

`tdcv2 pack add common en usa`

```
Installed common: 145 files → /path/to/project/tdcv2-packs/common
  registered ./tdcv2-packs in /path/to/project/tdcv2.config.json
Installed en: 324 files → /path/to/project/tdcv2-packs/en
  already registered in /path/to/project/tdcv2.config.json
Installed usa: 22 files → /path/to/project/tdcv2-packs/countries/usa
  already registered in /path/to/project/tdcv2.config.json
```

Which leaves three folders in the store, under the one `dataPaths` entry that covers all
of them — see [inside the pack store](#inside-the-pack-store).

This isn't a quirk of the file format. It reflects the fact that language and country
really are independent. English is shared by the US, the UK, and Canada, so it downloads
once as `en`, while country-specific data (US states, US area codes) lives in `usa`. Mix
and match to build whatever locale you need.

## Built-in default vs. downloaded

The built-in default set (shipped inside the package) is the **lowest layer**, and it's
always present. A downloaded set is laid **on top** and **shadows** the same addresses
without deleting anything underneath. Two things follow from that:

- install a full set → it **overrides** the default at those addresses;
- `pack remove` → the default **comes back** on its own. No hole in your data.

So installing and removing are both safe: the base set is never really deleted, only
shadowed for as long as a richer set sits above it.

## Where the base layer comes from

That base layer is found by asking three questions in order — the same three, in the same
order, in all five implementations:

| Order | Where                             | When it answers                                       |
| :---- | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | `TDCV2_PACKS`, if it names a folder | You set it, so it wins over everything else          |
| 2     | A TDC source checkout             | Only when TDC itself was built from source            |
| 3     | The set inside the installed package | Normally — this is what an installed package uses   |

Step 2 exists for people working on TDC itself: inside a checkout all five implementations
read the repository's own `data/packs`, so they see one copy of the data rather than five
that could drift apart. It cannot fire for an installed package, and it deliberately will
not settle for any folder named `data/packs` — the folder has to be recognisably the TDC
repository, so a folder of yours that happens to share the name is never picked up by
mistake.

`TDCV2_PACKS` is the escape hatch when you want to point every implementation at one folder
without editing any config:

```bash
TDCV2_PACKS=/srv/shared-packs tdcv2 users.tdc
```

Whatever `tdcv2.config.json` and `--data-path` name is layered **on top** of the answer,
never instead of it.

Two more variables shape the `pack` command rather than the search:

- **`TDCV2_NO_PICKER`** — set to anything, and `tdcv2 pack` with no subcommand prints the
  list instead of opening the full-screen picker. This is the way to get the printed list
  on a terminal; a script or a pipe gets it anyway.
- **`TDCV2_ASCII`** — set to anything, and the picker draws with ASCII glyphs and one map
  row per line. It is the manual override for when the Unicode auto-detection guesses
  wrong; `NO_COLOR` is separate and turns off colour only.
