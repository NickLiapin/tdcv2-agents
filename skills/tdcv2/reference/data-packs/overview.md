# Data Packs

A **data pack** is a self-describing file holding a list of values (first names, last
names, colors, anything) that TDC picks up automatically and exposes at a short
**dotted address**. You add new data **without touching code** — just drop a file into a
data folder.

> The example outputs below are illustrative: exact values can shift between core
> versions, but the shape and the proportions hold.

*Three independent axes, and one address reaching into all of them.*

- **A** — international data, the same in every locale
- **B** — the language axis: how names and words are spelled
- **C** — the country axis: what's specific to a single country
- **D** — one address — which bucket answers it depends on the run, not on the address itself

## The rules

- **One file = one homogeneous list = one address.** Male and female first names are
  different lists, each in its own file.
- **Data and declarative generators only — no executable code.** A pack is either "take
  a value from a list" or a generator written in TDC's own DSL (see
  [Writing your own](writing-your-own.md)). Nothing arbitrary runs, which is what keeps
  the cross-language guarantee intact and makes third-party packs safe to download.
- **Plain UTF-8, one value per line.** The extension doesn't matter (`.txt`, `.csv`, or
  none at all).

## How the address is formed

There are two ways, and they work together.

### From the folder structure (default)

The address is the file's path relative to the data folder, without the extension:

```text
data/packs/en/person/male/firstName.txt   →   en.person.male.firstName
data/packs/es/person/lastName.txt         →   es.person.lastName
```

Folder names become the dotted segments. Nothing to declare — the location **is** the
address. Use this for anything that fits a tidy folder tree; it's the whole story for
most packs.

One folder name is the exception: `countries/` never becomes a segment. A file at
`countries/usa/docs/ssn.txt` is addressed `usa.docs.ssn` — country packs are addressed by
the country, and the folder is only there to keep the store tidy.

### From a header (override)

If a file sits off on its own, or needs an address that doesn't match its folder, put
a **header** at the top, fenced by `---` lines:

```text
---
description: Color names
address: common.color.name
---
chrome
plasma-blue
void-black
```

TDC then uses `address:` instead of the path. The first segment must still be a locale
code, a country name, `common` or `user`. Use this when the address and the on-disk layout can't be the same —
a single shared file, a vendored third-party list, a generated pack.

### Header fields

All header fields are optional. The ones that build or redirect the address are
covered below; the fields that change how the body is read (weighted lists, external
files, generators) get their own worked examples in
[Writing your own](writing-your-own.md).

| Field         | Meaning                                                        | Where covered                            |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `description` | A human-readable description — "what this is"                  | below                                    |
| `address`     | An explicit address, overriding the one computed from the path | below                                    |
| `locale`      | Which language the pack speaks (`en`, `es`, `fr`…)             | below                                    |
| `file`        | Point at an external data file instead of an inline body       | below                                    |
| `column`      | With `file`: take a named/numbered column from a CSV           | below                                    |
| `delimiter`   | The column/value separator (default `,`)                       | below                                    |
| `weight`      | Make the pack weighted: the frequency column                   | [Writing your own](writing-your-own.md) |
| `weighted`    | `true` — the body is `value,weight` lines                      | [Writing your own](writing-your-own.md) |
| `generator`   | `tdc` — the body is a `<gen>`, not a list                      | [Writing your own](writing-your-own.md) |
| `inject`      | A custom interpolation marker for a generator                  | [Writing your own](writing-your-own.md) |

#### `description` — metadata

Free text describing the pack. It has no effect on the output — it's there for humans,
and for the editor autocomplete that reads it (see
[Editor support](../getting-started/editor-support.md)). Keep it short: "US city
names", "HTTP status codes".

#### `address:` — override the computed path

`address:` replaces the path-derived address. The file below sits outside any matching
folder tree, yet still resolves at `common.color.name`:

```text
---
address: common.color.name
---
chrome
plasma-blue
void-black
```

```xml
<gen type="template" value="common.color.name"/>
```

`./run colors.tdc (4 rows)`

```
plasma-blue
void-black
chrome
plasma-blue
```

Reach for this when a file can't sit where its address says it should: a shared list,
or a pack somebody else laid out.

#### `locale:` — which language the pack speaks

`locale:` tags the pack's language so locale-aware resolution can find it. The same
logical path resolves to different data per locale: `person.lastName` gives English
surnames under the default `en`, and `es.person.lastName` gives Spanish ones.

```xml
<gen type="template" value="person.lastName"/>
```

`./run last-en.tdc (4 rows)`

```
Smith
Johnson
Williams
Brown
```

```xml
<gen type="template" value="es.person.lastName"/>
```

`./run last-es.tdc (4 rows)`

```
Garcia
Fernandez
Rodriguez
Lopez
```

Set it when a pack's data is language-specific and its address doesn't already carry a
locale segment. See the [`template`](../generators/template.md) generator for how one
path maps across locales.

`locale:` also **supplies the segment the path is missing**. A file dropped straight
into your own folder — no locale tree above it — derives the address `gadget`, which
starts with no locale and so belongs nowhere. Its own header settles that:

```text
---
description: my own list
locale: en
---
Blender
Grinder
```

```xml
<gen type="template" value="gadget"/>
```

The pack is registered at `en.gadget`, and `value="gadget"` under `en` finds it. So a
file lands at its address by one of three routes: `address:` if the header names one,
otherwise the **path**, and `locale:` fills in the locale when the path alone leaves the
address homeless. All three work identically in every implementation.

A file that ends up at none of them — a header, but no `address:`, no `locale:`, and a
path starting with no locale, country or `common` — is not addressable and is left out.
The CLI says so at load time with a `TDC171` warning rather than letting it vanish.

#### A regional variant falls back to its base language

`en-gb`, `pt-br` and `de-at` are locales like any other, and most of them ship nothing of
their own. A run that names one gets its base language: `local="en-gb"` draws from `en`,
`local="pt-br"` from `pt`. Dates take the same step, so `de-at` reads `März` rather than
`March`.

That is what makes a variant pack cheap to write — it carries only what actually differs.
Drop a single `en-gb/geo/city.txt` in, and British cities win while every other address
still comes from `en`:

```text
packs/
  en-gb/
    geo/
      city.txt      ← only this differs
```

The step is taken **once**, and never as far as English. That single step is why
Traditional Chinese is shipped as `zh` rather than as `zh-tw`: Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Macau write the same script, all three of `zh-tw`, `zh-hk` and `zh-mo` reach `zh` in one
step, and none of them would reach a pack named after any one of the others. `zh-cn`
ships a full pack of its own and never falls back, so `zh` is precisely the slot the
Traditional locales share. The date tables follow the same split — `zh-cn` writes a short
weekday `周日`, the Traditional locales write `週日`.

#### An external file as the body — `file:`, `column:`, `delimiter:`

Instead of an inline body, a header can point at an existing file — useful for large
lists, or for reusing a CSV you already have. `file:` is the path (relative to the pack
file), `column:` picks a column by name or number, and `delimiter:` sets the separator
(a character, or one of the aliases `tab`, `semicolon`, `pipe`).

```text
---
description: US city names
file: ../../sources/us/cities.csv
column: name
delimiter: ,
---
```

```xml
<gen type="template" value="usa.city.name"/>
```

`./run cities.tdc (4 rows)`

```
Springfield
Riverside
Franklin
Clinton
```

The pack has no inline values — the body **is** the named column of that CSV. The same
three fields can also back a **weighted** list; that variant is covered in
[Writing your own](writing-your-own.md).

## Using an address

You call an address the way you call any [`template`](../generators/template.md)
generator. Pull the parts you want into named
[sequences](../core-concepts/sequences.md) and assemble them in the `.tdc`:

```xml
<tdc>
    <env count="4" seed="demo">
        <sequence name="First"><gen type="template" value="person.male.firstName"/></sequence>
        <sequence name="Last"><gen type="template" value="person.lastName"/></sequence>
    </env>
    <block><line><data>${{First}} ${{Last}}</data></line></block>
</tdc>
```

`./run people.tdc (4 rows)`

```
Michael Johnson
Robert Brown
James Smith
John Williams
```

The address `person.lastName` is just the file `en/person/lastName.txt` in the data
folder, and calling a `template` generator on it hands back values from that list.

### Compose the record shape yourself

The pack gives you the parts; the **shape** of the record is yours to build in the
`.tdc`. An English "First Last" and a Spanish "First Last1 Last2" are just two
arrangements of the same kind of pack:

```xml
<tdc>
    <env count="4" seed="es">
        <sequence name="First"><gen type="template" value="es.person.male.firstName"/></sequence>
        <sequence name="Last1"><gen type="template" value="es.person.lastName"/></sequence>
        <sequence name="Last2"><gen type="template" value="es.person.lastName"/></sequence>
    </env>
    <block><line><data>${{First}} ${{Last1}} ${{Last2}}</data></line></block>
</tdc>
```

`./run es-people.tdc (4 rows)`

```
Eduardo Restrepo Rosario
Ángel Suárez Vázquez
Cruz Salas Vásquez
Gilberto Ponce Barrios
```

The last row draws the **same** surname twice (`Rodriguez Rodriguez`): `Last1` and
`Last2` are two independent draws from one list, and nothing stops them from
colliding. When two fields in a row have to differ, wrap them in
[`<distinct>`](../constructs/unique-values.md) — the mechanics are covered in
[Writing your own](writing-your-own.md).

## More than lists

A pack isn't limited to a flat list. It can also be:

- a **weighted** list — each value's real-world frequency, laid out exactly, with the
  same Hamilton method as [`percent`](../generators/text.md);
- a small **generator** written in the DSL — a [`regex`](../generators/regex.md)
  pattern, a name assembled from neighboring lists, or a
  [`<mix>`](../reference/tags.md) that splits by exact percentage.

By convention, generator files use the `.tdc` extension and plain data stays `.txt`, so
the two are easy to tell apart. Both kinds are safe to ship and download — a generator
is a parsed, sandboxed DSL, never arbitrary code — and both are covered end to end in
[Writing your own](writing-your-own.md).

## Where packs live

- The **built-in set** ships in the repo under `data/packs/` and is scanned
  automatically on startup.
- **Your own folders** are added with the CLI flag `--data-path <folder>` (repeatable)
  or the library's `dataPaths`. See [Installing packs](installing-packs.md) for the
  `tdcv2 init` / `tdcv2 pack` flow.

## Errors

Problems are caught at load time, **before** any generation runs:

- **Two files claiming the same address** → `TDC170`, naming both files. Rename or move
  one.
- **A pack file that lands nowhere** — a header, but nothing that gives it a locale,
  country or `common` first segment → `TDC171`, a warning naming the file. Add
  `address:` or `locale:`, or move it under a locale folder.
- **A typo in a path** in the config (`value="person.male.firstNam"`) → `TDC071`,
  `unknown template path`.

`./run typo.tdc`

```
TDC071: unknown template path 'person.male.firstNam'
  did you mean 'person.male.firstName'?
```

Hidden files (anything starting with `.`) and `README` / `LICENSE` / `CHANGELOG` are
ignored by the scanner.

Address autocomplete in the editor is driven by those same `description:` headers, and
it ships — see [Editor support](../getting-started/editor-support.md).

## Describing a folder

A folder of packs can say who wrote it, under what licence and at what version, by
carrying a `_pack.json` — see
[Writing your own](writing-your-own.md#describing-a-folder--_packjson). Nothing in
it reaches the generated data; `tdcv2 pack info` reads it back.
