# Writing your own pack

The simplest pack is a plain file, one value per line, addressed by its path (see
[Overview](overview.md#how-the-address-is-formed)). From there, a **header** unlocks
weighted lists, external files, and small generators — all without touching engine
code, and all safe to share, since a pack is never more than data or a parsed,
sandboxed DSL.

The example outputs below are **illustrative**: exact values depend on the seed and can
shift between core versions. What is guaranteed — determinism per seed, and the exact
proportions — is called out where it matters.

## The header

Put fields between two `---` lines at the top of the file. All are optional:

| Field         | Meaning                                                                 |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description` | A human-readable description — "what this is"                           |
| `address`     | An explicit address, overriding the one computed from the path          |
| `locale`      | Language (`en`, `es`, `ru`…) — and the locale segment a flat path lacks |
| `file`        | Point at an external data file instead of an inline body                |
| `column`      | With `file`: take a named/numbered column from an existing CSV          |
| `delimiter`   | With `file` CSV, or a weighted body: the separator (default `,`)        |
| `weight`      | With `file`: the frequency column that makes the pack weighted          |
| `weighted`    | `true` — the body is `value,weight` lines                               |
| `generator`   | `tdc` — the body is a [`<gen>`](../generators/overview.md), not a list |
| `inject`      | A custom interpolation marker for the generator                         |

Each of these is covered below, with a config and its output.

## Weighted packs — frequency from the data

A plain pack is drawn from **uniformly**: `Smith` comes up as often as `Zabrowski`.
Real life isn't like that — over 2.4 million Americans are named `Smith`. A weighted
pack fixes that, and it's **exact**, laying the frequencies out with the Hamilton
(largest-remainder) method — the same guarantee as
[`percent`](../generators/text.md#exact-proportions-with-percent). There are two ways
to supply the weights.

### Inline body — `weighted: true`

Set `weighted: true` and write each line as `value,weight`:

```text
---
description: US surnames, weighted (2010 Census)
weighted: true
---
Smith,2442977
Johnson,1932812
Williams,1625252
…
```

(The real `en` pack carries the census top 1000; three lines are enough to show the
shape.)

You call it like any other pack — nothing changes in the config:

```xml
<sequence name="Last">
    <gen type="template" value="person.lastName"/>
</sequence>
```

Across 100,000 rows, each surname shows up in proportion to its weight — `Smith` about
2,000 times, matching the 2.02% share its count holds among those thousand names:

`./run surnames.tdc (100,000 rows)`

```
Smith      2022
Johnson    1599
Williams   1345
```

Use this form when the list is short and you want the weights right next to the values.

### External CSV — `file:` + `weight:`

When the list is large and already lives in a file of its own, point at it with `file:`
and name the frequency column with `weight:` (and the value column with `column:`):

```text
---
description: US surnames, weighted (2010 Census)
file: ../../../sources/us/person/lastName.csv
column: name
weight: count
---
```

The call is identical; the header change is invisible from the config's side:

```xml
<gen type="template" value="person.lastName"/>
```

Use this form to point at a big census or catalog CSV without copying it into the pack.

The proportions are exact in **both** engines — the streaming default and
`mode="memory"` alike. A weight is a **non-negative integer** (a raw count, not a
percentage). An empty weight cell (`Smith,`) is an error, not a silent zero, and a
deliberate `0` excludes the value.

### Values that contain commas — `delimiter:`

If your values are phrases that contain commas of their own (notifications, whole
sentences), a comma separator would split them in the wrong place. Set `delimiter:` to
any character, or to one of the aliases `tab`, `semicolon`, `pipe`:

```text
---
weighted: true
delimiter: @
---
Your order, ready for pickup, has shipped@100
New message, marked urgent@50
```

The line is split on its **last** delimiter, so commas inside a value survive:

`./run notices.tdc (30 rows)`

```
Your order, ready for pickup, has shipped
New message, marked urgent
Your order, ready for pickup, has shipped
```

The same `delimiter:` also sets the column separator for an external `file:` CSV.

## Generators in a pack — `generator: tdc`

A pack can return a **generator** instead of a list, so that the address yields a
_computed_ value. It's written in TDC's own DSL, so there's nothing new to learn. Set
`generator: tdc` in the header; the body is a [`<gen>`](../generators/overview.md). Here
is a US-style license plate — three letters, a dash, four digits:

```text
---
description: US license plate
address: usa.vehicle.plate
generator: tdc
---
<gen type="regex" value="[A-Z]{3}-[0-9]{4}"/>
```

Call it exactly like a list-backed template:

```xml
<gen type="template" value="usa.vehicle.plate"/>
```

`./run plates.tdc`

```
FZY9944
YHZ8189
LRG8608
```

It runs on the same engine as your config, so every guarantee holds — determinism, and
portability to the future Python and Java runtimes — and it's **safe** even when
downloaded, because it's a parsed, limited DSL with no system access. Give generator
files a `.tdc` extension (data files stay `.txt`) so you can tell them apart at a
glance; the file name becomes the last address segment (`plate.tdc` → `…plate`).

### Assembling from data

A generator can pull neighboring data lists in by address and build a value out of them.
The body is a **compound sequence** — the individual draws, each with a name you reach
through a dot — plus one [`<data>`](../core-concepts/output-formatting.md) that says
what to return.

Names resolve to English under the default `en` locale. This example deliberately sets
`locale: es` to show a naming convention English doesn't have: a Spanish full name made
of two given names and two surnames.

```text
---
description: Spanish full male name
generator: tdc
locale: es
---
<sequence name="p">
  <distinct>
    <gen name="f1" type="template" value="es.person.male.firstName"/>
    <gen name="f2" type="template" value="es.person.male.firstName"/>
  </distinct>
  <distinct>
    <gen name="l1" type="template" value="es.person.lastName"/>
    <gen name="l2" type="template" value="es.person.lastName"/>
  </distinct>
</sequence>
<data>${{p.f1}} ${{p.f2}} ${{p.l1}} ${{p.l2}}</data>
```

`./run es-fullname.tdc`

```
Antonio Javier García Fernández
Miguel Rodrigo López Romero
Carlos Alejandro Martín Ruiz
```

The data (`firstName`, `lastName`) lives in its own files; the generator only assembles
it. The [`<distinct>`](../constructs/unique-values.md) tag says that the two draws from
a single list must **differ** within a row — otherwise two independent draws could
collide and hand you `Juan Juan`.

### Exact percentages inside a generator — `<mix>` + `percent`

A [`<mix>`](../reference/tags.md#distributions-and-choice) with `percent` works inside
a generator, and the split is **exact** by row count. Say 60% of people get **two**
surnames and 40% get **one**:

```text
---
description: Spanish surname — 60% double, 40% single
address: es.person.surname
generator: tdc
---
<mix name="s" percent="60,40">
  <case>
    <gen type="template" value="es.person.lastName"/>
    <data> </data>
    <gen type="template" value="es.person.lastName"/>
  </case>
  <case>
    <gen type="template" value="es.person.lastName"/>
  </case>
</mix>
<data>${{s}}</data>
```

`./run es-surname.tdc (100 rows)`

```
García Fernández
López
Martín Romero
Ruiz
```

Over 100 rows, exactly 60 carry two surnames and 40 carry one — the split is laid out
with Hamilton over the whole `count` rather than left to chance.

**Engine note.** That share is a quota over the whole column, which no streaming engine
can apportion a row at a time, so a config using this pack runs on the in-memory engine
and its memory grows with `count`. A pack without `percent=` costs nothing. See [Which
engine runs your config](../guides/large-outputs.md#which-engine-runs-your-config).

Inside a [`<case>`](../reference/tags.md#distributions-and-choice), build the value out
of the tags themselves — [`<gen>`](../generators/overview.md), plus
[`<data>`](../core-concepts/output-formatting.md) for any literal text between them.

A `<data>` there may also **read the row it is on**: `${{Name}}` inside a case resolves the
same way it does in an output line, filters included.

```text
<sequence name="City"><gen type="text" value="Alpha,Beta,Gamma"/></sequence>
<mix name="s" percent="60">
  <case><data>${{City}} North</data></case>
  <case><data>${{City|upper}} South</data></case>
</mix>
<data>${{s}}</data>
```

That is a different thing from a `<gen type="template">` beside it: the generator draws a
NEW value, while a reference keeps the record coherent with what the row already holds. A
name nobody declared is refused (`TDC193`) rather than printed literally.

### A custom interpolation marker — `inject:`

Sometimes a generator's **output** has to contain a literal `${{ }}` — you're generating
GitHub Actions workflows, Handlebars, or Go templates. Set your own marker with
`inject:`, using exactly one `%` to mark where the name goes, and TDC's substitution
stops colliding with your text:

```text
---
address: common.ci.deploy_step
generator: tdc
inject: <<%>>
---
<sequence name="s"><gen name="env" type="text" value="prod,staging"/></sequence>
<data>  - run: deploy.sh --token ${{ secrets.TOKEN }} --env <<s.env>></data>
```

Here `<<s.env>>` is TDC's substitution, while `${{ secrets.TOKEN }}` passes through
untouched. The output (shown as a code block, because it literally contains the
`${{ }}` marker):

```text
  - run: deploy.sh --token ${{ secrets.TOKEN }} --env prod
  - run: deploy.sh --token ${{ secrets.TOKEN }} --env staging
```

The marker is **isolated** — it doesn't depend on the main config's `inject`, so the
same generator behaves identically wherever you plug it in. Without `inject:`, the
default stays `${{%}}`.

### A generator that calls another generator

A generator can reference **another generator**, not just a list — a "full name" can
draw on a "surname" generator that decides single vs. double on its own. TDC checks at
load time that there's **no cycle** (A → B → A, or a self-reference) and fails with
`generator reference cycle: …` before generation starts, rather than recursing forever.

## `<distinct>` — no repeats in one row

Two independent draws from one list will sometimes collide (`James James`). Wrap the
fields — or whole sequences — that must **differ within a row** in
[`<distinct>`](../constructs/unique-values.md):

```xml
<sequence name="pair">
    <distinct>
        <gen name="a" type="template" value="person.male.firstName"/>
        <gen name="b" type="template" value="person.male.firstName"/>
    </distinct>
</sequence>
```

`./run pair.tdc`

```
James and Robert
William and John
Michael and David
```

`James and Robert` is fine; `James and James` never appears. On a collision the engine
redraws one of the values, and determinism per seed still holds. It works both inside a
[`<sequence>`](../core-concepts/sequences.md), wrapping `<gen>`, and inside `<env>`,
wrapping whole sequences.

Don't confuse it with [`uniq`](../constructs/unique-values.md): `uniq` keeps a whole row
from repeating anywhere in the **entire** dataset (vertical), while `<distinct>` keeps
fields **within one row** from matching (horizontal). Both are implemented, and they're
independent of each other.

## Where custom packs go

- The **built-in set** ships in the repo under `data/packs/` and is scanned
  automatically at startup.
- **Your own folders** are added with the CLI flag `--data-path <folder>` (repeatable)
  or with the library's `dataPaths` — see [Installing packs](installing-packs.md).

## Errors and ignored files

- **Two files claiming the same address** → `TDC170`, naming both files. Rename or move
  one.
- **A file that lands at no address** — a header, but no `address:`, no `locale:`, and a
  path whose first segment is no locale, country or `common` → `TDC171`, a warning
  naming the file. It is skipped, so a later `value=` naming it fails with `TDC071`.
- **A typo in a path** in the config (`value="person.lastNam"`) → `TDC071`,
  "unknown template path", raised before generation starts.
- Hidden files (anything starting with `.`) and `README` / `LICENSE` / `CHANGELOG` are
  **ignored** by the scanner.

Address autocomplete in the editor is driven by those same `description:` headers, and
it ships — see [Editor support](../getting-started/editor-support.md). Write a description
worth reading and it is what the person completing an address will see beside it.

## Describing a folder — `_pack.json`

A pack folder is all content and no provenance: the lists and generators say what
they produce and nothing about where they came from. That is fine while the only
packs are the bundled ones, and stops being fine the moment somebody hands you a
folder and asks whether the data you built from it may be shipped.

Drop a `_pack.json` at the top of the folder — beside `_locale.json`, if there is
one:

```json
{
  "name": "Acme internal packs",
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "license": "MIT",
  "author": "Acme Data Team",
  "homepage": "https://acme.example/packs",
  "description": "Product codes and internal identifiers."
}
```

Every field is optional, and **nothing here reaches the generated data**. A
manifest cannot change a single value: the same seed gives the same bytes whether
it is there or not.

Read it back with `tdcv2 pack info`:

`tdcv2 pack info`

```
Packs that describe themselves:

  mypacks
    name:        Acme internal packs
    version:     1.2.0
    license:     MIT
    author:      Acme Data Team
    homepage:    https://acme.example/packs
    description: Product codes and internal identifiers.

  mypacks/en
    license:     CC-BY-4.0
    description: English lists, from the 2019 open census extract.
```

### Where it is looked for

Each configured data path, and **each folder one level inside it**. That covers
the two shapes a manifest has: "this whole folder is my pack" and "this locale
inside it came from somewhere of its own".

It stops there deliberately. Walking deeper would invite a manifest per `.txt`
file, and the question this answers — who wrote this data, and under what licence
— is not one a single list of city names has its own answer to.

### What happens when it is wrong

`tdcv2 pack info` **refuses** a manifest that will not parse, or one whose `name`,
`version`, `license`, `author`, `homepage` or `description` is not text. Reading
that file is the whole of that command's job, and a licence its author wrote that
nobody can read is worse than one nobody wrote.

A **run never mentions it**. The manifest reaches no value, so stopping a
generation over it would be blocking work on a field the work never reads.

Keys TDC does not know are kept quietly, so a folder written for a newer version —
or carrying your own tooling's fields beside these — still works here.
