# Increment & Decrement — counters

**Use them when** you need a running counter instead of a random value — a
sequential id or row number (1, 2, 3…), an SKU series that climbs by a fixed step,
or a countdown that falls to zero.

Both live inside a [`<sequence>`](../core-concepts/sequences.md): the sequence is
computed once as an array, and each output row pulls the next value with
`${{Name}}` [interpolation](../core-concepts/output-formatting.md).

## At a glance

| Attribute | Applies to               | Default | What it does                       |
| :-------- | :----------------------- | :------ | :--------------------------------- |
| `value`   | `increment`, `decrement` | `0`     | Starting value                     |
| `step`    | `increment`, `decrement` | `1`     | Amount to add or subtract each row |

Both counters are **position-based and deterministic**: each row takes the
next value in the run. They ignore the [`seed`](../core-concepts/determinism.md)
entirely (unlike the random generators), so the sequence is identical on every run —
the outputs on this page are exact, not just illustrative.

## `increment` — a rising counter

Each row is the previous value plus [`step`](#step--the-stride). With the defaults
(`value="0"`, `step="1"`) it counts up by one, but the common case is an id column
that starts at 1.

```xml
<sequence name="Id"><gen type="increment" value="1"/></sequence>
```

`./run demo.tdc (count=5)`

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

Use it whenever you want a stable, gap-free id or row number — every row gets its own
sequential value, and the whole column is reproducible across runs.

## `decrement` — a falling counter

Each row is the previous value minus [`step`](#step--the-stride). Same two
attributes; only the direction flips.

```xml
<sequence name="Countdown"><gen type="decrement" value="100"/></sequence>
```

`./run demo.tdc (count=5)`

```
100
99
98
97
96
```

Reach for `decrement` when you need a countdown, a remaining-quantity column, or
any reverse numbering that starts high and works its way down.

## `step` — the stride

[`step`](../reference/attributes.md) sets how far the counter moves between rows.
It defaults to `1`. Give two counters the same start (`value="1"`) and different
steps, and the stride is the only difference — the left one counts by one, the right
one by five:

```xml
<sequence name="ByOne"><gen type="increment" value="1"/></sequence>
<sequence name="ByFive"><gen type="increment" value="1" step="5"/></sequence>
...
<data>${{ByOne}}   ${{ByFive}}</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc (count=6)`

```
step=1   step=5
1        1
2        6
3        11
4        16
5        21
6        26
```

`step` works the same on `decrement` — it controls how big each drop is:

```xml
<sequence name="Full"><gen type="decrement" value="1000"/></sequence>
<sequence name="ByHundred"><gen type="decrement" value="1000" step="100"/></sequence>
```

`./run demo.tdc (count=5)`

```
step=1   step=100
1000     1000
999      900
998      800
997      700
996      600
```

Use a custom `step` for series that don't move by one: SKUs spaced by 5, a price
that falls by a fixed amount, a gauge that ticks in tens.

### Fractional steps

`step` (and `value`) accept decimals, not just integers, which covers prices,
percentages, or any measured quantity that moves in fractions:

```xml
<sequence name="Price"><gen type="decrement" value="9.99" step="0.50"/></sequence>
```

`./run demo.tdc (count=5)`

```
9.99
9.49
8.99
8.49
7.99
```

## Deterministic by design

Counters never touch the random engine, so the same config produces the same run
regardless of [`seed`](../core-concepts/determinism.md). Two runs with different
seeds give byte-for-byte identical counter columns:

```xml
<gen type="increment" value="1" step="10"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc — seed=alpha vs seed=omega (count=5)`

```
seed=alpha   seed=omega
1            1
11           11
21           21
31           31
41           41
```

That makes counters the reliable spine of a dataset: id columns and row numbers stay
put even when every random field around them changes.

## Just need the row number?

If all you want is the current row number inside the output template, there's a
built-in [`${{_count}}`](../reference/builtins.md) — no sequence needed. It starts
at 1 and rises by one per record.

Reach for an `increment` sequence instead when you need the counter as a **named
value** — something to reuse in several places, format with a
[mask](../guides/masks-and-case.md), start somewhere other than 1, or advance by a
step other than 1.
