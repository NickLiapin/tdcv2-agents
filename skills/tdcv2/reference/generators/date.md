# The `date` generator

**Use it when** you need a date or a date-time — a birthday, a document date, an
event timestamp — inside a range and printed in a specific format.

Dates run on TDC's own portable date runtime: a strict parser, a UTC calendar, and
a localized formatter, with no dependency on moment.js. The same config is designed
to produce the same dates in every implementation.

Example outputs below are illustrative — the exact values depend on the seed and
can differ by core version. What stays fixed is the shape and the format.

## At a glance

| Attribute             | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Use only one of `value`, `range`, or the `from`/`to` pair to describe a range — they
are three spellings of the same thing. Give none of them and the range runs from
`1970-01-01` to the current moment; see
[No bounds at all](#no-bounds-at-all--the-clock-closes-the-range).

The last four attributes belong to a **walked** range and are read only alongside
`order="sequential"`. On a drawn date `step` or `weekdays` would be silently ignored, so
they are refused instead (`TDC248`).

## A random date in a range

Give `value` a range as `START..END` (both ends **inclusive**) and you get a random
date drawn uniformly inside it.

```xml
<gen type="date" value="2020-01-01..2025-12-31" format="YYYY-MM-DD"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc (5 rows)`

```
2024-08-15
2022-02-04
2020-06-21
2025-10-04
2021-03-31
```

The endpoints are part of the window. A one-week range makes that easy to see —
over enough rows, both `2024-06-01` and `2024-06-07` show up:

```xml
<gen type="date" value="2024-06-01..2024-06-07" format="YYYY-MM-DD"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc (6 rows)`

```
2024-06-06
2024-06-03
2024-06-01
2024-06-07
2024-06-02
2024-06-02
```

Input dates are parsed **strictly**, in one of these forms:

- date: `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY.MM.DD`, or `YYYY/MM/DD`;
- date-time: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm`, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss`, or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSS`;
- range: `START..END`.

Free text (`June 6th`, `06/06/24`) is **not** accepted — use one of the strict forms
above.

### The `range` attribute — the same window, a newer spelling

`range="START..END"` means exactly what `value="START..END"` does. It reads better
when `value` would otherwise look like a keyword, and it's the spelling shared with
the [`date.range`](../generators/template.md) template.

```xml
<gen type="date" range="2020-01-01..2024-12-31" format="YYYY-MM-DD"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc (5 rows)`

```
2023-11-08
2021-09-30
2020-05-23
2024-10-19
2021-01-14
```

The [`format`](../reference/attributes.md) attribute only controls how the date is
written — it never changes the window, and the window never depends on the format.

### `from` and `to` — the endpoints given separately

When it's clearer to name the two ends separately, use `from` and `to`. This is the
most natural spelling for date-time windows, where the range would otherwise be one
long string.

```xml
<gen type="date"
     from="2026-05-02T09:00:00"
     to="2026-05-02T09:00:05"
     format="YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc (5 rows)`

```
2026-05-02T09:00:04
2026-05-02T09:00:01
2026-05-02T09:00:03
2026-05-02T09:00:00
2026-05-02T09:00:02
```

### No bounds at all — the clock closes the range

A `date` generator given **neither** end still produces a date. The window runs from
`1970-01-01` to the current moment, so the generator reads the clock even though nothing
in the config mentions a date:

```xml
<gen type="date" format="YYYY-MM-DD"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc  —  the same seed, a year apart`

```
--now 2026-04-23    --now 2027-04-23
1972-06-01          1972-06-17
1994-11-20          1995-04-30
1972-05-06          1972-05-21
```

This is the easiest way to lose reproducibility by accident. Give the generator two ends,
or pin the clock with [`--now`](../reference/cli.md#--now--pin-the-clock).

**One** end is not a third option for a range you DRAW from: `from` without `to` is
`TDC150`, and `range="2020-01-01.."` is `TDC151`. Where a value is sampled, a single end
says nothing about what to sample. One end IS enough when the range is
[walked](#a-date-axis-walking-the-range-instead-of-drawing-from-it) — that is the next
section.

## A date axis: walking the range instead of drawing from it

Everything above **draws**: each row picks a date at random from the window. Ask for a
row per day for a year and you get repeats and gaps, because that is what drawing means.

Add `order="sequential"` and the range is **walked** instead. Row 0 is the start, row 1
is one step on, row _i_ is `start + i × step`. This is the time axis a run needs when the
data is a series rather than a sample: readings, transactions, a log.

### `from` alone — an axis with no end

A walked axis takes only a start. Its last row is `start + (count − 1) × step` — row 0 is
the start itself — which is a consequence of the run's length rather than something you
work out and write down:

```xml
<gen type="date" from="2026-01-01" order="sequential" format="YYYY-MM-DD"/>
```

`./run axis.tdc (count=5)`

```
2026-01-01
2026-01-02
2026-01-03
2026-01-04
2026-01-05
```

Raise `count` to a million and the axis simply runs a million days. Nothing is expanded
into a list, so the range costs no memory however long it is.

### `step` — how far each row moves

The default is one day. `step` takes a number and a unit, and units add up:

| Written     | Means              | Group    |
| :---------- | :----------------- | :------- |
| `15m`       | 15 minutes         | fixed    |
| `1h30m`     | 90 minutes         | fixed    |
| `2` or `2d` | 2 days             | fixed    |
| `1w`        | 7 days             | fixed    |
| `3mo`       | 3 calendar months  | calendar |
| `1y6mo`     | 18 calendar months | calendar |

`m` is the **minute**, as it is in every notation of this shape. The month is `mo`,
because `m` is taken — and not `M`, since a difference of forty-four thousand between
three minutes and three months should not rest on the case of one letter.

<gen type="date" from="2026-01-01T09:00:00" order="sequential"
     step="15m" format="YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm"/>
```

`./run axis.tdc (count=4)`

```
2026-01-01 09:00
2026-01-01 09:15
2026-01-01 09:30
2026-01-01 09:45
```

A step is EITHER fixed or calendar, never both. `15m` is always 900,000 milliseconds; a
month is 28 to 31 days. They add up within their own group and `step="1mo15d"` is refused
(`TDC247`), because "a month and fifteen days" is 43, 44, 45 or 46 days depending on which
half you apply first, and a config whose meaning turns on an invisible ordering is worse
than one that will not parse. Write `45d`, or `1mo`.

### A calendar step keeps the day of the month

Each step is measured **from the start**, never accumulated. That distinction is invisible
on days and decides the answer on months:

```xml
<gen type="date" from="2026-01-31" order="sequential" step="1mo" format="YYYY-MM-DD"/>
```

`./run axis.tdc (count=4)`

```
2026-01-31
2026-02-28
2026-03-31
2026-04-30
```

February clamps to the 28th, and March goes back to the 31st. Stepping on from the clamped
February would have given 28 March and dragged every later month with it.

### `weekdays` — keeping only some days

A filter, not a step:

```xml
<gen type="date" from="2026-01-01" order="sequential"
     weekdays="mon..fri" format="ddd YYYY-MM-DD"/>
```

`./run axis.tdc (count=6)`

```
Thu 2026-01-01
Fri 2026-01-02
Mon 2026-01-05
Tue 2026-01-06
Wed 2026-01-07
Thu 2026-01-08
```

Friday to Monday is a three-day jump, which is exactly why this is not a step: a step
keeps the spacing even, and a filter breaks it. Keeping them apart is what lets them
combine — "every 12 hours, working days only" needs both words:

```xml
<gen type="date" from="2026-01-02T00:00:00" order="sequential"
     step="12h" weekdays="mon..fri" format="ddd YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm"/>
```

`./run axis.tdc (count=6)`

```
Fri 2026-01-02 00:00
Fri 2026-01-02 12:00
Mon 2026-01-05 00:00
Mon 2026-01-05 12:00
Tue 2026-01-06 00:00
Tue 2026-01-06 12:00
```

Spans use `..`, like every other range in TDC, and a list uses commas: `weekdays="sun,wed"`.
A span **wraps**, so `fri..mon` is Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday — a week is a circle,
and refusing to go round it would make half the spans unwritable.

Two kinds of step refuse `weekdays` (`TDC250`), for two different reasons.

A **whole number of weeks** lands on the same weekday every time, so the filter would
match every row or none of them — a full column or an empty one, with nothing said either
way. That is measured on the step's length, so `14d` is refused exactly as `2w` is, while
`10d` is fine.

A **calendar step** — `1mo`, `3mo`, `1y` — is refused for the opposite reason: it does
_not_ fix the weekday. The 15th walks Thursday, Sunday, Sunday, Wednesday, Friday, Monday
across the first half of 2026. Which rows survive a weekday filter would follow the
calendar rather than anything written in the config, so the step and the filter are asked
to be one or the other.

If what you wanted was a **monthly date moved onto the next working day** — the way a
billing system moves an invoice off a Sunday — that is not expressible today, and the
filter would not do it: it would drop February entirely rather than move it. A
**working-day calendar** is a different thing and does work: `step="1d"` with
`weekdays="mon..fri"`, as above.

### A bounded range wraps

Give a walked range both ends and it loops when it runs out, the way a short list does:

```xml
<gen type="date" range="2026-01-01..2026-01-03" order="sequential" format="YYYY-MM-DD"/>
```

`./run axis.tdc (count=7)`

```
2026-01-01
2026-01-02
2026-01-03
2026-01-01
2026-01-02
2026-01-03
2026-01-01
```

`cycle="false"` turns running out into a refusal instead:

`./run axis.tdc (range of 2 days, count=4, cycle=false)`

```
tdcv2: order="sequential" cycle="false": the source has only 2 values, so row 3 has none — shorten count= or lengthen the source
```

An **open** axis has no end to wrap at, so `cycle` means nothing there.

## A birthday with `value="birth"`

`value="birth"` produces a date of birth relative to the current date, bounded by an
age window. `youngest` and `oldest` are ages **in years** (defaults `10` and `80`),
so `youngest="18" oldest="65"` gives working-age adults.

```xml
<gen type="date" value="birth" youngest="18" oldest="65" format="MM/DD/YYYY"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc (5 rows)`

```
07/05/1997
11/23/1985
02/14/2003
09/30/1971
06/18/1990
```

**Why use it instead of a fixed range:** the window follows "now", so the same config
still produces plausible ages next year, with no dates to go back and edit. For a
birthday tied to a whole synthetic person, the
[`person.b_day`](../generators/template.md) template takes the same
`oldest`/`youngest`/`format` attributes.

That is also why the dates move. The window slides forward with the clock, so the same
seed gives a different birth date tomorrow — the age holds, the date does not. Where the
output has to stay put — a snapshot test, a fixture, a bug report — pin the clock with
[`--now`](../reference/cli.md#--now--pin-the-clock).

## `today` and `now`

`value="today"` is the current date; `value="now"` is the current date **and** time.
Both read from the runtime clock, so they're the natural stamps for "generated on"
or "as of" fields.

```xml
<gen type="date" value="today" format="LL"/>
<gen type="date" value="now"   format="YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSS"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
value="today" format="LL"                       April 23, 2026
value="now"   format="YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSS"   2026-04-23T12:00:00.000
```

Reading the clock is the point of both, and it is what makes them non-reproducible: the
seed has no say in what "today" is. Pin the clock with
[`--now`](../reference/cli.md#--now--pin-the-clock) and `today` and `now` return the
instant you named, in every run.

## `precision` — the step for date-time ranges

`precision` sets the smallest step a range moves in: `day`, `second`, or
`millisecond`. For a five-second window stepped by whole seconds:

```xml
<gen type="date"
     from="2026-05-02T09:00:00"
     to="2026-05-02T09:00:05"
     precision="second"
     format="YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc (5 rows)`

```
2026-05-02T09:00:04
2026-05-02T09:00:01
2026-05-02T09:00:03
2026-05-02T09:00:00
2026-05-02T09:00:02
```

When `precision` is omitted, the default follows the range type:

| Range type               | Default step        | What `precision` changes                              |
| :----------------------- | :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| date-only (`YYYY-MM-DD`) | one **day**         | rarely needed — the range already steps in whole days |
| date-time                | one **millisecond** | `precision="second"` zeros the milliseconds           |

Use `precision="second"` whenever you want clean, human-looking timestamps instead of
millisecond noise; use `precision="millisecond"` (the date-time default) when you need
sub-second resolution.

## An interval: a date measured from another date

Real records are full of pairs: admitted and discharged, ordered and shipped,
issued and expires, the start and the end of a shift. The second date is not
independent of the first — it is the first plus a length — and two separate
ranges cannot say so. They put the discharge _before_ the admission on a good
share of the rows.

`of` names the column to measure from and `plus` says how far:

```xml
<sequence name="Admitted">
  <gen type="date" from="2026-01-01" to="2026-03-01" format="YYYY-MM-DD"/>
</sequence>
<sequence name="Discharged">
  <gen type="date" of="Admitted" plus="2..14d" format="YYYY-MM-DD"/>
</sequence>
```

`./run stay.tdc (6 rows)`

```
2026-02-06  2026-02-16
2026-02-14  2026-02-23
2026-01-11  2026-01-16
2026-01-11  2026-01-24
2026-02-27  2026-03-06
2026-01-08  2026-01-14
```

Every discharge is after its own admission, by 2 to 14 days — and the _length_
of each stay is drawn per row, which is the thing two independent ranges throw
away.

### `plus` — the distance

| Written as | Means                                                  |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `7d`       | exactly seven days, on every row                       |
| `3..10d`   | three to ten days, drawn per row (both ends inclusive) |
| `1..3mo`   | one to three months, by the calendar                   |
| `-10..-3d` | three to ten days **before** the source                |
| `45`       | a bare number means days                               |

The units are the ones [`step`](#step--how-far-each-row-moves) already uses:
`s`, `m`, `h`, `d`, `w`, `mo`, `y` — and as there, `m` is the minute and `mo` is
the month.

A single value is the same distance on every row:

```xml
<sequence name="Shipped">
  <gen type="date" of="Ordered" plus="1d" format="YYYY-MM-DD"/>
</sequence>
```

`./run ship.tdc (4 rows)`

```
2026-05-23  2026-05-24
2026-05-06  2026-05-07
2026-05-13  2026-05-14
2026-05-21  2026-05-22
```

Write the smaller bound first, as in every other range. To count **backwards**,
make both bounds negative — `plus="-10..-3d"` is three to ten days earlier.
`plus="10..3d"` is a typo and is refused (`TDC264`) rather than quietly swapped.

Months and years move by the calendar rather than by a fixed number of days, so
`2026-01-31` plus one month is `2026-02-28` — the same clamping
[`step`](#a-calendar-step-keeps-the-day-of-the-month) does.

### The offset reads the value, not the printed text

A date column prints a _rendering_ of its date. `03/02/2026` is the 3rd of
February under `local="en"` and the 2nd of March under `local="ru"`, and
`format="MMMM D"` throws the year away entirely. So the offset does not read the
cell at all: the column it measures from keeps the date it generated, and the
arithmetic runs on that. Any `format` works, under any locale.

```xml
<env count="4" seed="visit" local="ru">
  <sequence name="Visit"><gen type="date" from="2026-03-01" to="2026-03-31"/></sequence>
  <sequence name="Followup"><gen type="date" of="Visit" plus="2w"/></sequence>
</env>
```

`./run visit.tdc (4 rows)`

```
20.03.2026  03.04.2026
22.03.2026  05.04.2026
27.03.2026  10.04.2026
09.03.2026  23.03.2026
```

The one case with nothing to read from is a date TDC did not generate — a column
loaded by [`file`](./file.md), for instance. There only the text exists, so it
must be in ISO form (`YYYY-MM-DD`), which means one thing in every locale.
Anything else is refused rather than guessed at.

### The source may be walked, drawn, or another offset

`of=` reads whatever the named column produced. A **walked** source is the pairing real
records ask for most — orders march down the calendar day by day, and delivery is a few
days after **its own** order:

```xml
<sequence name="Ordered">
  <gen type="date" from="2026-01-01" order="sequential" step="1d" format="YYYY-MM-DD"/>
</sequence>
<sequence name="Delivered">
  <gen type="date" of="Ordered" plus="2..9d" format="YYYY-MM-DD"/>
</sequence>
```

`./run orders.tdc (4 rows)`

```
2026-01-01  2026-01-06
2026-01-02  2026-01-06
2026-01-03  2026-01-12
2026-01-04  2026-01-11
```

The one source that has no single date to measure from is a **repeating** one: a cell built
with `repeat=` holds several dates joined by a separator. That is refused by name rather
than answered with an empty column.

### Chaining, and empty cells

An offset is itself a date this engine produced, so a third column can measure
from it: signed, expires a year later, remind a month before that.

```xml
<sequence name="Signed"><gen type="date" from="2026-01-15" to="2026-02-15" format="D MMMM YYYY"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Expires"><gen type="date" of="Signed" plus="1y" format="D MMMM YYYY"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Remind"><gen type="date" of="Expires" plus="-30d" format="D MMMM YYYY"/></sequence>
```

`./run lease.tdc (4 rows)`

```
5 February 2026 | 5 February 2027 | 6 January 2027
31 January 2026 | 31 January 2027 | 1 January 2027
13 February 2026 | 13 February 2027 | 14 January 2027
20 January 2026 | 20 January 2027 | 21 December 2026
```

A row whose source has no date — one that a `parent` filter left out, or one
[`missing`](../guides/missing-data.md) blanked — gets no date either. There is
nothing to measure from, and inventing one would put a confident-looking value
in a cell the config said should be empty.

### In a branch

An offset reads only its own row, so it can be one branch of a per-row choice as well: a
[`<case>`](../constructs/switch.md#case--a-branch-with-a-generator), at any depth, or one of a
sequence's `<gen if="…">` branches. Each row the branch holds is measured from its own date.

```xml
<tdc>
  <env count="6" seed="ship" local="en">
    <sequence name="Ordered"><gen type="date" from="2026-03-01" to="2026-03-31" format="MMMM D"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Method"><gen type="text" value="courier,pickup"/></sequence>
    <switch name="Ready" on="Method">
      <case is="courier"><gen type="date" of="Ordered" plus="2..5d" format="MMMM D"/></case>
      <case is="pickup"><data>same day, at the counter</data></case>
    </switch>
  </env>
  <block><line><data>${{Ordered}} | ${{Method}} | ${{Ready}}</data></line></block>
</tdc>
```

`./run shipping.tdc`

```
March 23 | courier | March 27
March 6 | courier | March 11
March 13 | pickup | same day, at the counter
March 21 | pickup | same day, at the counter
March 7 | pickup | same day, at the counter
March 17 | courier | March 19
```

A ranged `plus=` in a branch draws each row's step from that row's own stream, so a row keeps
its step when the branch split around it changes.

### What `of` rules out

`of` places the date relative to another column, so the attributes that place its
**own** draw say nothing any more: `value`, `from`, `to`, `range`, `oldest`,
`youngest`, `order` and `step`. Writing one beside `of` is refused (`TDC264`)
rather than ignored — a config that asks for June dates and gets January ones is
right about what it asked for and wrong about what it got.

The column named by `of` must be declared **above** the offset (`TDC240`), the
same rule [`running`](./running.md) and [`stat`](./stat.md) follow.

An offset is a column computed from another one, so it is not a part or a field of a composed
`<sequence>` (`TDC295`): a record's parts are drawn together, and a computed date moved to
another row no longer describes it. Declare it as a sequence of its own.

The formatting layer is ruled out too, for the same reason it is on a running total:
an offset is built in declaration order, before that layer runs. `mask`, `case`,
`missing`, `missing_as`, `repeat`, `anomaly`, `anomaly_factor` and `percent` are
refused (`TDC015`) rather than ignored. Apply one where the value is **printed**
instead — `${{Later|mask:x}}`, `${{Later|upper}}` — which is where it works today.

A plain `type="date"` with no `of` reads every one of them normally; it is the offset
that cannot.

An offset reads a sibling column as the row is built, which the streaming path
cannot do yet, so a config using one is built [in memory](../guides/large-outputs.md).
TDC routes it there on its own; you only notice if you force the streaming engine with
`--engine 2`, which refuses it by name rather than approximating.

## Formatting the output

`format` is a template of tokens. It changes only how a date is **written** — the
underlying value is untouched. The default is `L` (a locale-aware short date).

Here is every token, applied to one fixed moment: **Tuesday, March 5, 2024,
09:04:07**. The day and the month are single-digit on purpose, so the padded and
unpadded pairs differ visibly:

| Token      | Means                         | Example                        |
| :--------- | :---------------------------- | :----------------------------- |

| `YY`       | 2-digit year                  | `24`                           |
| `MMMM`     | full month name               | `March`                        |
| `MMM`      | short month name              | `Mar`                          |
| `MM`       | 2-digit month                 | `03`                           |
| `M`        | month, no leading zero        | `3`                            |
| `DD`       | 2-digit day                   | `05`                           |

| `ddd`      | short weekday name            | `Tue`                          |
| `HH`       | 2-digit hour (24h)            | `09`                           |
| `H`        | hour, no leading zero         | `9`                            |
| `mm`       | 2-digit minute                | `04`                           |
| `m`        | minute, no leading zero       | `4`                            |

| `s`        | second, no leading zero       | `7`                            |

Month and weekday names, and the four `L` forms, follow the locale — see
[below](#locale-aware-formats-l-and-ll). Everything else is the same in every
language.

The same date under four formats — same seed, so the date is identical on each line
and only the writing differs:

```xml
<gen type="date" value="2020-01-01..2024-12-31" format="YYYY-MM-DD"/>
<gen type="date" value="2020-01-01..2024-12-31" format="DD.MM.YYYY"/>
<gen type="date" value="2020-01-01..2024-12-31" format="DD MMM YYYY"/>

### Literal text with brackets

Anything in square brackets is copied through verbatim, so you can wrap a date in
fixed text:

```xml
<gen type="date" value="2024-03-15..2024-03-15" format="[date:] YYYY-MM-DD"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
date: 2024-03-15
```

### Locale-aware formats: `L` and `LL`

`L`, `LL`, `LLL` and `LLLL` follow the locale, taken from the `local` attribute (or
`local` on [`<env>`](../reference/tags.md)) — as do the name tokens `MMMM`, `MMM`,
`dddd` and `ddd`. The default locale is `en`. Numeric templates like `YYYY-MM-DD` and
`DD.MM.YYYY` never depend on the locale — only on the template you write.

Where the words come from: twenty-four locales are built into the engine, and any
other locale whose data pack ships a `DATE_LOCALE.json` — seventy do — translates
its dates the moment the pack is visible. Georgian, Latvian, Kazakh and their kind
render their own months and weekdays now, including the in-a-date month form
(`15 იანვარს`), where they used to fall back to English without a word. A shipped
file carries `L` and `LL`; `LLL` and `LLLL` are taken from it when it writes them
and derived otherwise — `LL` plus the time, the weekday in front. A locale with no
date words at all still renders English, and the validator says so rather than
letting it pass silently.

Here is the fixed date `2024-03-15` under `format="LL"`, first in the default English
locale, then re-rendered with `local="ru"` to show the localized month name and
long-date form — a deliberate localization demo:

```xml
<gen type="date" value="2024-03-15..2024-03-15" format="LL"/>            <!-- default en -->
<gen type="date" value="2024-03-15..2024-03-15" format="LL" local="ru"/> <!-- Russian -->
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
default (en)   March 15, 2024
local="ru"     15 марта 2024 г.
```

`L` shifts the same way: `03/15/2024` in `en`, `15.03.2024` in `ru`.

## Gotchas, in one place

- Input dates are parsed **strictly** — use `YYYY-MM-DD` (or `.` / `/`), not free text.
- Both range endpoints are **inclusive**.
- `value`, `range`, and `from`/`to` are three spellings of one window — use whichever reads best.
- `L` / `LL` change with `local`; `YYYY-MM-DD` and friends do not.
- Date-only ranges step by day; date-time ranges by millisecond unless you set `precision`.
- `order="sequential"` WALKS the range; without it every row is an independent draw.
- On a walked axis `m` is the minute and `mo` is the month. `step="1mo15d"` is refused —
  write `45d` or `1mo`.
- `weekdays` filters, `step` paces. They combine, and neither replaces the other.
- `today`, `now`, `value="birth"` and a generator with **no** bounds read the clock, so
  the seed alone does not reproduce them — pin the clock with
  [`--now`](../reference/cli.md#--now--pin-the-clock).
- `of` measures from another column and `plus` says how far. The column named must be
  declared **above**, and the attributes that bound the generator's own draw (`from`, `to`,
  `value`, `range`, `order`, `step`, `oldest`, `youngest`) are refused beside it.
- An offset works from the date the source column generated, not from the text it printed,
  so any `format` and any `local` are fine. Only a date TDC did not generate — one read from
  a file — has to be in ISO form.
- `format` applies **only** to dates. On template identifiers (SSN, IBAN, phone…) it is an error — shape those with [interpolation filters](../core-concepts/output-formatting.md) instead.

## See also

- [`format`](../reference/attributes.md), [`range`](../reference/attributes.md), and [`local`](../reference/attributes.md) in the attribute reference.
- **[Template](../generators/template.md)** — `person.b_day` and `date.range` share this same date formatting.
