# The `formula` generator

**Use it when** a column is not drawn but **computed** — from the other columns of the
same row. A weight that follows a height. A BMI from both. A price times a quantity. A
remainder you want to print rather than test.

```xml
<gen type="formula" expr="0.75 * Height - 58 + 6 * Z" decimals="1"/>
```

`expr=` is the same little language as [`if=`](../reference/expressions.md) — the same
operators, the same functions, the same names for the same columns. The only difference is
where the answer goes: `if=` consumes it as a yes/no, and a formula keeps it as the value
of its column.

| Attribute  | What it sets                                                              |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `expr`     | **Required.** The arithmetic this column is                               |
| `decimals` | Digits after the point, 0 to 10. Without it the value prints in full      |

## A column that follows another one

Real data is not a set of independent columns — weight follows height, income follows
education, area follows price. A formula is how you say so:

```xml
<sequence name="Height"><gen type="number" distribution="normal" mean="170" sd="10" decimals="1"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Z">     <gen type="number" distribution="normal" mean="0" sd="1" decimals="4"/></sequence>

<sequence name="Weight"><gen type="formula" expr="0.75 * Height - 58 + 6 * Z" decimals="1"/></sequence>
<sequence name="BMI">   <gen type="formula" expr="Weight / pow(Height / 100, 2)" decimals="1"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Label"> <gen type="formula" expr="BMI > 25 ? over : normal"/></sequence>
```

`./run clinic.tdc`

```
152.3,62.1,26.8,over
187.3,73.4,20.9,normal
172.9,69.6,23.3,normal
164.9,59.8,22.0,normal
159.3,60.9,24.0,normal
157.4,63.9,25.8,over
```

`Height` is drawn, `Z` is the noise that keeps the relationship from being a straight line,
and the other three are computed. **`Z` never has to be printed** — leave a column out of
`<block>` and it stays in the calculation without reaching the file. A data-science config
usually has several of those.

The last line is worth noticing on its own: a ternary makes a formula produce a **label**,
not only a number, which is how a training set gets its target column.

## Division, and the remainder you can print

Division is real here, and always was — it is the one operator that cannot stay whole,
because the whole numbers are not closed under it:

```xml
<sequence name="N">   <gen type="number" value="1..20"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Half"><gen type="formula" expr="N / 2"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Rem"> <gen type="formula" expr="N % 3"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Row"> <gen type="formula" expr="_count"/></sequence>
```

`./run numbers.tdc`

```
n=15 half=7.5 rem=0 row=1
n=9  half=4.5 rem=0 row=2
n=9  half=4.5 rem=0 row=3
n=5  half=2.5 rem=2 row=4
```

`_count` and every other [built-in](../reference/builtins.md) is readable, so a trend by
hand is `expr="100 + 0.05 * _count"`.

> [!NOTE]
> **A comparison prints `true` / `false`, not 1 / 0**
>
> `expr="BMI > 25"` gives the word `true`, matching `_last`, `_first` and every
> `anomaly_flag` column — one spelling for a flag across the whole engine.
>
> A training set usually wants the other shape, and the ternary is right there:
>
> ```xml
> <gen type="formula" expr="BMI > 25 ? 1 : 0"/>
> ```

## Whole numbers stay whole

An operand that IS a whole number is carried as one and only becomes a double when
something asks it to. So a formula is exact wherever its inputs are exact — `1000000 *
1000000` is the right answer here, not a rounded one — and only becomes approximate when
the config asked for something inexact. The rules are the same as everywhere else in the
expression language and are written out in
[Expressions](../reference/expressions.md#whole-numbers).

> [!CAUTION]
> **Two fractions are rarely equal**
>
> `0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3` is **false**, here and in every other language, because 0.1 has no exact
> binary form. That is honest IEEE arithmetic rather than a quirk of this engine — but it
> means a branch written as `if="A + B == 0.3"` may never fire. Compare with `<` and `>`, or
> round both sides first.

## An empty source makes an empty answer

A cell that [`parent=`](../core-concepts/sequences.md) or [`missing=`](../guides/missing-data.md)
left empty is not a zero, and a formula reading it produces nothing rather than
inventing a number:

```xml
<sequence name="H" parent="G.M"><gen type="number" value="170..190"/></sequence>
<sequence name="W"><gen type="formula" expr="H * 2"/></sequence>
```

`./run people.tdc`

```
F,,
F,,
M,170,340
M,172,344
```

The rows where `H` has no value leave `W` empty too. That is the same rule
[running](running.md) and [stat](stat.md) follow when they skip an emptied cell,
seen from the other side — and it is what makes a formula safe to put over a
`missing=` column: the blanks stay blanks instead of turning into arithmetic.

## In a branch

A formula reads only its own row, so it can also be one branch of a per-row choice: a
[`<case>`](../constructs/switch.md#case--a-branch-with-a-generator) of a `<switch>` or a
`<mix>`, at any depth, or one of a sequence's `<gen if="…">` branches. Each row the branch
holds is computed from that row.

```xml
<tdc>
  <env count="6" seed="shop" local="en">
    <sequence name="Qty"><gen type="number" value="0..4"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Total"><gen type="number" value="10..90"/></sequence>
    <switch name="Each" on="Qty">
      <case is="0"><data>nothing bought</data></case>
      <default><gen type="formula" expr="Total / Qty" decimals="2"/></default>
    </switch>
  </env>
  <block><line><data>${{Qty}},${{Total}},${{Each}}</data></line></block>
</tdc>
```

`./run shop.tdc`

```
0,77,nothing bought
4,76,19.00
4,46,11.50
4,81,20.25
1,70,70.00
0,59,nothing bought
```

`Total / Qty` is a division by zero on the rows where `Qty` is 0, and those rows belong to the
other case — so the formula is never asked about them. The same column written with `if=`
works the same way:

```xml
<sequence name="Each">
  <gen if="Qty > 0" type="formula" expr="Total / Qty" decimals="2"/>
  <gen type="text" value="nothing bought"/>
</sequence>
```

`_count` inside a branch is the row's own number, as it is everywhere else. Two things stay
out of a branch, and `check` says so with [`TDC295`](../reference/errors.md): a formula that
reads `prev()`, because it needs the rows before it and is built in row order over the whole
run, and any formula used as a part or a field of a composed `<sequence>`. Compute it as a
sequence of its own and put it into the record where the record is printed.

## The wrappers a formula does not take

`mask=`, `case=`, `missing=`, `missing_as=`, `repeat=`, `anomaly=` and
`anomaly_factor=` are refused with [`TDC015`](../reference/errors.md) rather than
accepted and ignored. A formula is resolved before the formatting layer runs — the
same position `running` and `stat` hold.

The answer already exists one step later and is better, because it works where the
value is PRINTED:

```xml
<data>${{Weight|mask:x}}</data>
```

## Which layer: formula or `<compute>`

Both compute a value, and the split is not a matter of taste:

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`formula`** | mathematics — fractions, division, functions, anything derived |
| **[`<compute>`](../compute/overview.md)** | check digits and text shaping — mod-11, Luhn, padding, slicing |

`<compute>` is deliberately whole-number-only, because that is what a check digit needs.
Writing a formula in its tag tree is possible and miserable: `(x - lo) / (hi - lo)` is a
screenful of nesting there and thirteen characters here.

## What `check` refuses

Everything a formula needs is knowable from the config, so none of it waits for the run:

- **no `expr=`** — [`TDC294`](../reference/errors.md). A formula IS its expression.
- **an `expr=` that does not parse** — `TDC294`, pointing at the offending token.
- **a name that is not a column declared above** — [`TDC240`](../reference/errors.md),
  the same code `running` and `stat` use for the same rule, with a `did you mean` when the
  name is close to a real one. This is the one that matters most: a typo in an `if=` is a
  bare word and the branch quietly stops firing, but a typo in a formula reaches
  arithmetic.
- **a formula where it cannot mean anything** — [`TDC295`](../reference/errors.md): one that
  reads `prev()` inside a `<case>` or an `if=` branch, and any formula as a part or a field of
  a composed `<sequence>`. See [In a branch](#in-a-branch).

The run refuses two more, because they depend on the values rather than the config:
arithmetic on a **text** column (which is where `NaN` would otherwise come from, and a
file full of `NaN` nobody was warned about is worse than a stopped run), and a **division
by zero**.

## Details

- **Reads its own row.** Row *i* is computed from row *i* and nothing else, so a formula
  consumes no randomness — adding one leaves every other column exactly where it was.
- **Declaration order.** A formula is built out of columns that already exist, so every
  name in `expr=` must belong to a sequence declared above it.
- **It streams.** Reading only its own row is exactly what the
  [streaming engine](../guides/large-outputs.md) is built on, so a formula runs there like
  any drawn column — memory stays flat as the row count grows. Measured on one config:
  1M rows 2.1 s, 5M rows 3.9 s, 20M rows 9.5 s and a 291 MB file, with peak memory rising
  1.3× while the row count rose 20×. The in-memory engine on the same 5M config took 12.5 s
  and used more memory, and cannot reach 20M at all.

  This is what separates a formula from [running](running.md) and [stat](stat.md): those
  two need rows other than this one — every row before, and every row at all — so they stay
  in memory by definition, not by omission.
