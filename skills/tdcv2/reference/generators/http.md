# The `http` generator

**Use it when** the value has to come from logic TDC doesn't have — a real check-digit
algorithm you already wrote, a lookup in your own database, any calculation that would
be painful to express in the config. You stand up a small service, and TDC calls it: it
becomes the **client** of your service, not the host of your code. That is the extension
point — anything you can put behind an HTTP endpoint becomes part of your data.

## Two modes: it generates, or it processes

One attribute decides which, and the two are genuinely different jobs:

|             | `in`    | what your service receives | what it does                                       |
| :---------- | :------ | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **Source**  | absent  | nothing but a count        | invents the values itself — it acts as a generator |
| **Handler** | present | your values, one per line  | transforms what you sent and hands it back         |

Both at once, against the same service — the first column is handed over and comes back
changed, the second is conjured from nothing:

```xml
<sequence name="City">
  <gen type="text" value="Paris,Berlin,Tokyo" order="sequential"/>
</sequence>

<sequence name="Handled">
  <gen type="http" src="http://127.0.0.1:5599/gen" in="City"/>   <!-- handler -->
</sequence>

<sequence name="Made">
  <gen type="http" src="http://127.0.0.1:5599/gen"/>             <!-- source -->
</sequence>
```

`./run modes.tdc`

```
Paris  ->  [Paris ok]    |  Made: SRC-000
Berlin ->  [Berlin ok]   |  Made: SRC-001
Tokyo  ->  [Tokyo ok]    |  Made: SRC-002
```

The handler mode is the more useful of the two, and the one that is easy to miss. It lets
a service you already have **finish** a value TDC started rather than replace the
generator outright: validate it, add a check digit, look it up, translate it.

Your service tells the two apart by the request body: **an empty body means source
mode**, and the `X-TDC-Count` header says how many values to invent.

*The column of inputs is sent in one request; the reply comes back one value per row, in the same order. Here the service upper-cases each value (a → A).*

- **A** — the input column — the values your sequence produced
- **B** — your service: TDC only talks to it, never runs it
- **C** — the reply — one value per row, in the order sent

## Attributes

| Attribute  | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src`      | the service URL — `http://127.0.0.1:5566/gen` (local, fast) or a public host. `https` works too                                                                                       |
| `in`       | the sequence whose value is sent on each row — this is what turns the service into a **handler**. Omit it and the service is a **source**: it receives nothing and invents each value |
| `on_error` | `fail` (default) — stop with a clear message; or `empty` — blank the cell and continue                                                                                                |
| `timeout`  | seconds to wait for one answer before giving up. Default 30                                                                                                                           |
| `secret`   | the key each request is **signed** with, so your service can tell TDC from anyone else who can reach the port. Three spellings — see [Proving the request came from TDC](#proving-the-request-came-from-tdc) |

`in` names an **earlier** sequence — the value it produced on each row is what gets sent.

## The contract your service implements

The engine speaks one small protocol and expects nothing else back:

- **`POST`** to `src`, with a header **`X-TDC-Count: N`** — how many values are wanted.
- **`Content-Type: text/plain`**, exactly that, with no charset parameter. All five
  implementations send the same string, so a service may match it literally.
- The **body** is the `N` input values, **one per line**, in row order. With no `in`,
  the body is empty and `N` comes from the header.
- **`X-TDC-Input: N`** travels whenever `in` is present, and says how many input lines the
  body holds. It is what tells a handler from a source when the body cannot: `in` naming a
  column of one empty value sends an empty body, which is byte for byte what a source sends.
  A service that ignores the header reads the body exactly as it always did.
- **`X-TDC-Seed`** is eight hex digits derived from the run's seed and the sequence name —
  the same value every time, and different for every sequence, so a service that generates
  from it can be reproducible on its own.
- **`X-TDC-Timestamp`** and **`X-TDC-Signature`** travel only when the config carries
  [`secret`](#proving-the-request-came-from-tdc).
- The **response** must be exactly **`N` lines**, in the same order — line _i_ answers
  input line _i_. Plain text.

Anything structured is your service's job. If it works with JSON internally, it
returns the one field you want, as text — inside TDC every value is a string anyway.

**One request per column, not per row.** The engine sends the whole batch at once, so a
thousand rows is one request. A service written "one line in, one line out" still works
— it just loops over the lines of the one request it receives.

*Why a thousand rows is one request. The per-row shape (left) would be a thousand round trips; TDC sends the whole column in one (right).*

- **A** — one request per row — what TDC does NOT do; it would be a call per value
- **B** — one request for the whole column — the whole batch, one round trip

This is what keeps it fast: the cost is one round trip plus your service's own work,
not a network round trip per value. It's also why `http` runs on the in-memory engine
([one of six shapes that
do](../guides/large-outputs.md#which-engine-runs-your-config)), and why it's best
pointed at a service on your own machine, or at a run you have sized on purpose — not a
billion rows against a distant endpoint.

## A whole service, in five languages

Each of these is complete and answers **both** modes: it wraps whatever you send, and
invents values when the body is empty. Pick your language — they behave identically.

#### Node.js

```js
import { createServer } from 'node:http';

createServer((req, res) => {
  const chunks = [];
  req.on('data', (c) => chunks.push(c));
  req.on('end', () => {
    const count = Number(req.headers['x-tdc-count'] ?? '0');
    const sent = Buffer.concat(chunks).toString('utf8');

    const out =
      sent === ''
        ? Array.from({ length: count }, (_, i) => 'SRC-' + String(i).padStart(3, '0')) // source
        : sent.split('\n').map((line) => '[' + line + ' ok]'); // handler

    const body = out.join('\n');
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain', 'Content-Length': Buffer.byteLength(body) });
    res.end(body);
  });
}).listen(5801, '127.0.0.1');
```

#### Python

```python
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

class H(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_POST(self):
        n = int(self.headers.get("Content-Length", 0))
        sent = self.rfile.read(n).decode() if n else ""
        count = int(self.headers.get("X-TDC-Count", "0"))

        if sent == "":
            out = [f"SRC-{i:03d}" for i in range(count)]          # source
        else:
            out = [f"[{line} ok]" for line in sent.split("\n")]   # handler

        body = "\n".join(out).encode()
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header("Content-Length", str(len(body)))
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(body)

HTTPServer(("127.0.0.1", 5802), H).serve_forever()
```

#### Java

```java
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class S3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress("127.0.0.1", 5803), 0);
        server.createContext("/", exchange -> {
            String sent = new String(exchange.getRequestBody().readAllBytes(),
                                     StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
            String raw = exchange.getRequestHeaders().getFirst("X-TDC-Count");
            int count = Integer.parseInt(raw == null ? "0" : raw);

            List<String> out = new ArrayList<>();
            if (sent.isEmpty()) {
                for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) out.add(String.format("SRC-%03d", i));  // source
            } else {
                for (String line : sent.split("\n", -1)) out.add("[" + line + " ok]");  // handler
            }

            byte[] body = String.join("\n", out).getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
            exchange.sendResponseHeaders(200, body.length);
            try (OutputStream os = exchange.getResponseBody()) { os.write(body); }
        });
        server.start();
    }
}
```

#### C#

```csharp
using System.Net;
using System.Text;

var server = new HttpListener();
server.Prefixes.Add("http://127.0.0.1:5804/");
server.Start();

while (true)
{
    HttpListenerContext ctx = server.GetContext();
    using var reader = new StreamReader(ctx.Request.InputStream, Encoding.UTF8);
    string sent = reader.ReadToEnd();
    int count = int.Parse(ctx.Request.Headers["X-TDC-Count"] ?? "0");

    IEnumerable<string> lines = sent.Length == 0
        ? Enumerable.Range(0, count).Select(i => $"SRC-{i:D3}")     // source
        : sent.Split('\n').Select(line => $"[{line} ok]");          // handler

    byte[] body = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(string.Join("\n", lines));
    ctx.Response.ContentLength64 = body.Length;
    ctx.Response.OutputStream.Write(body);
    ctx.Response.Close();
}
```

#### Rust

```rust
use std::io::{BufRead, BufReader, Read, Write};
use std::net::TcpListener;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:5805")?;
    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        let mut stream = stream?;
        let mut reader = BufReader::new(stream.try_clone()?);

        let (mut length, mut count) = (0usize, 0usize);
        loop {
            let mut line = String::new();
            if reader.read_line(&mut line)? == 0 || line == "\r\n" {
                break;
            }
            let lower = line.to_ascii_lowercase();
            if let Some(v) = lower.strip_prefix("content-length:") {
                length = v.trim().parse().unwrap_or(0);
            } else if let Some(v) = lower.strip_prefix("x-tdc-count:") {
                count = v.trim().parse().unwrap_or(0);
            }
        }

        let mut sent = vec![0u8; length];
        reader.read_exact(&mut sent)?;
        let sent = String::from_utf8_lossy(&sent);

        let out: Vec<String> = if sent.is_empty() {
            (0..count).map(|i| format!("SRC-{i:03}")).collect()             // source
        } else {
            sent.split('\n').map(|line| format!("[{line} ok]")).collect()   // handler
        };

        let body = out.join("\n");
        write!(
            stream,
            "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\nContent-Length: {}\r\n\r\n{body}",
            body.len()
        )?;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

No crates: the standard library has a TCP listener, and an HTTP request is a few
lines of headers followed by a body.

Start one, point `src` at its port, and run the config from
[Two modes](#two-modes-it-generates-or-it-processes) — all five produce the same output.

## When it goes wrong

The service is outside TDC's control, so failures are handled, not hidden:

- **`on_error="fail"`** (the default) stops the run with a message naming the sequence
  and the service — `http service for sequence "Checked" at … returned 500`. A blank
  column in a finished file is a worse surprise than a clear stop.
- **`on_error="empty"`** blanks the affected column and finishes, for when a best-effort
  output is what you want. Checking for the gaps is then on you.
- **`429` (rate limited) always stops**, even under `empty`. "Slow down" and "stream a
  whole column" cannot be reconciled, and continuing would quietly truncate the data.
- A service that **never answers** is cut off by `timeout` rather than hanging the run.
- A service that **floods** — answering with far more than one value per line — is cut
  off at 64 MB with an error instead of being read into memory to the end.
- A **`secret` that cannot be read** — an unset variable, a missing file — stops the run
  before any request goes out, naming the sequence. Sending the batch unsigned instead
  would be the one outcome the attribute exists to prevent.

## Proving the request came from TDC

A service that answers `http` requests is doing real work — hashing a password, minting an
account number, calling a model that costs money. If it is reachable by anything other than
your own machine, it should be able to tell TDC's requests from anyone else's.

`secret=` does that **without ever putting the key on the wire**. Each request carries a
timestamp and a signature computed from the secret; the service recomputes the same thing
with its own copy and compares.

```xml
<sequence name="Hashed">
  <gen type="http" src="https://svc.example.com/hash" in="Password"
       secret="env:TDC_HTTP_SECRET"/>
</sequence>
```

Two extra headers travel with the request:

```
X-TDC-Timestamp: 1786000000
X-TDC-Signature: hex(HMAC-SHA256(secret, timestamp \n seed \n count \n body))
```

Everything that decides the answer is inside the signature — change the body, the count,
the seed or the minute and it no longer matches. Verifying it is a few lines:

```js
const mine = crypto
  .createHmac('sha256', process.env.TDC_HTTP_SECRET)
  .update(`${ts}\n${seed}\n${count}\n${body}`)
  .digest('hex');
if (mine !== req.headers['x-tdc-signature']) return res.status(401).end();
```

All five implementations produce the **same** signature for the same request, so one
service accepts requests from any of them.

### Where the key lives

| Spelling                            | Where it reads from                                              |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `secret="env:TDC_HTTP_SECRET"`      | an environment variable — **the recommended one**                |
| `secret="file:~/.tdc/service.key"`  | a file, trimmed; relative paths resolve beside the config         |
| `secret="k7Fm2p…"`                  | the value itself — works, and warns ([`TDC284`](../reference/errors.md)) |

The literal warns rather than fails because a service on `127.0.0.1` for an afternoon is a
real use. But a config goes into version control and the key goes with it, which is why the
other two spellings exist. `secret=""` is an error: signing with nothing produces a
signature anyone could forge.

### What signing does and does not do

- It proves the sender **holds the secret**, and that the request was not altered on the way.
- The timestamp is what makes a captured request useless tomorrow — **how strict that
  window is, is your service's decision.** TDC sends its real clock, not the run's
  `--now`, so a config pinned to a past date still works.
- The secret has **no expiry**. A test that runs once a quarter signs correctly with a key
  set months ago, which is why this is a signature and not an expiring token.
- It does **not hide the contents.** Over plain `http://` the body and reply are visible to
  anyone listening. If real secrets travel through the service, use `https://` as well —
  the two solve different problems.
- The signature changes every run, because the timestamp does. That has no effect on the
  data, which was never reproducible for `http` anyway.

## What it does not promise

This is the one generator that trades away guarantees the rest of TDC keeps. State them
to yourself before reaching for it:

- **Not reproducible.** The service decides the values, so `seed` guarantees nothing and
  **re-running gives different data**. A config using `http` is never treated as
  reproducible.
- **Order follows the service**, not the seed.
- **Local or modest volumes.** Over the internet, a large run is a large number of
  outbound calls — this is for a service on your own machine, or a run you have sized on
  purpose. Not for a billion rows against a public endpoint.
- **From the library, only the async path.** A network call cannot come out of a
  synchronous function, so `toString()` and `writeFile()` **throw** on an `http` config.
  Use [`toStringAsync()` / `writeFileAsync()`](../bindings/typescript.md#terminal-methods)
  — the CLI already does. Nothing to do if you run it from the command line.
