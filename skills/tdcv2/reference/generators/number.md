# The `number` generator

**Use it when** you need an integer — an id, a code, a price, an age — inside a
range; or a string of exactly _N_ digits (even hundreds or thousands of them, far
past what an ordinary number type can hold).

The `number` generator has several modes, chosen by which of `value` and `length`
you provide. This page walks through each one.

## At a glance

| Attribute    | Required | What it does                                                        |
| :----------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `value`      | no       | `bit`, one number `"50"`, a list `"10,20,35"`, a range `"100..999"`, or any mix |
| `length`     | no       | Fixed width `"10"`, a range `"2-10"`, or groups `"2,10-12"`         |
| `percent`    | no       | Shares for `length` groups, e.g. `length="2,10-12" percent="85,15"` |
| `first_zero` | no       | `true` / `false` — whether a leading zero is allowed                |
| `include`    | no       | Add numbers or ranges to `value`                                    |
| `exclude`    | no       | Remove numbers or ranges from `value`                               |
| `decimals`   | no       | Digits after the decimal point, `0`–`10` — makes the column fractional |

With **no** `value` and **no** `length`, `number` emits a single random digit
`0`–`9`.

`./run demo.tdc`

```
7
2
9
0
4
```

## A single bit

`value="bit"` gives a random `0` or `1`, which is what a boolean-style flag needs.

```xml
<gen type="number" value="bit"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
1
1
1
1
0
```

## One number, or a few

`value` takes a single number when the column should always hold it, and a
comma-separated list when it should hold one of a few:

```xml
<gen type="number" value="50"/>        <!-- always 50 -->
<gen type="number" value="10,20,35"/>  <!-- one of the three -->
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
50        35
50        20
50        35
50        20
50        10
```

Both forms exist so that a constant or a small set of numbers stays **inside the
numeric generator**, where the numeric attributes mean what they say. Before, neither
was accepted here and the only way to write "always 50" was `<gen type="text"
value="50"/>` — a list of strings that happen to look like a number. That works, and
it still does, but the checking is different in a way that matters: a text list is
checked by reading it, so `value="hello,50"` with `anomaly=` passes and then quietly
spikes only half as often as you asked, because a word cannot be multiplied. In
`number` every value is a number by construction, so a declared rate is a delivered
rate.

## A range

Give `value` a range as `from..to` (inclusive) and you get a random integer inside
it.

```xml
<gen type="number" value="1000..9999"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
7990
6325
8602
6092
3258
```

Two rules about the syntax:

- The separator is **always** `..`, never a single dash.
- A single `-` inside `value` is the **minus sign** of a negative number, so
  so a negative range needs no escaping:

```xml
<gen type="number" value="-500..-200"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
-267
-322
-246
-330
-425
```

### Leading zeros are kept

If the range is written with leading zeros, the width is preserved, which is what
fixed-width codes need:

```xml
<gen type="number" value="0000..9999"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
7767
5916
8446
5658
2509
```

## Several ranges at once

Pass a comma-separated list of bracketed ranges and TDC first picks one range at
random, then a number inside it.

```xml
<gen type="number" value="[0..100],[345..678],[1934..2026]"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
1952
662
1975
664
85
```

## Fixed width with `length` (padding)

When you give **both** `value` and `length`, `length` acts as a display width:
short numbers are padded with leading zeros, longer ones print as-is. Same seed,
so the numbers are identical — only the width changes:

```xml
<gen type="number" value="1..999"/>            <!-- raw -->
<gen type="number" value="1..999" length="4"/> <!-- same series, width 4 -->
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
raw    length="4"
770  →  0770
350  →  0350
79   →  0079
959  →  0959
208  →  0208
```

The numbers didn't change — they were just padded to four digits. In this padding
mode a leading zero is allowed by default (so a short value can reach the width).

## `decimals` — a fractional column

**Problem.** A price, a rate, a measurement. `value="1..999"` gives you whole numbers;
`decimals="2"` gives you the same range with two digits after the point.

```xml
<gen type="number" value="1..999" decimals="2"/>
```

`./run price.tdc`

```
776.15
591.50
843.99
```

`decimals` takes an integer **0 to 10**. Anything else stops the run:

`./run price.tdc (decimals="11")`

```
tdcv2: number decimals must be an integer 0..10, got "11"
```

It **replaces** `length` rather than joining it — a fractional value has no integer
width to pad, so the pair is `TDC278`:

`tdcv2 check price.tdc`

```
error[TDC278]: length="8" is not read beside decimals="2" — a fractional value has no integer width to pad
```

It does not combine with [`include` / `exclude`](#add-and-remove-numbers-include--exclude)
either. For a fractional column drawn from a **shape** rather than a flat range, see
[Statistical distributions](../guides/statistical-distributions.md).

## Digit-string mode

Give `length` **without** `value` and the generator switches modes: it assembles
the result digit by digit and always returns a string of exactly that length. This
is not a JavaScript number — it's text — so you can generate identifiers hundreds
or thousands of digits long.

```xml
<gen type="number" length="10" first_zero="true"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
7299399441
5929481897
8462586083
5905900972
2876831899
```

Here `first_zero="true"` allows a leading zero. None of these five happen to start with
one — a leading zero is one draw in ten, so a short sample often has none. Over 200 rows
it appears 16 times; without the attribute, 0 times. That is the whole of what it does:
the first digit in this mode is never zero unless you ask for it.

### Variable length

`length` can itself be a range, or groups with shares:

```xml
<gen type="number" length="2-10"/>                       <!-- random length 2..10 -->
<gen type="number" length="2,10-12" percent="85,15"/>    <!-- 85% short, 15% long -->
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
length="2-10"            → 70270136
length="2,10-12" 85/15   → 77
```

The `percent` here works exactly like it does for [`text`](text.md#exact-proportions-with-percent):
over `count="100"`, exactly 85 values are length 2 and 15 are length 10–12.

## `first_zero` — control the leading zero

`first_zero` decides whether the **first** digit may be `0`. The default depends on
the mode:

- **Padding mode** (with `value`): a leading zero is **allowed** by default, so
  padding can reach the width. `first_zero="false"` forbids it — TDC then draws a
  value that already has enough digits:

```xml
<gen type="number" value="0..9999" length="4"/>                    <!-- zero ok -->
<gen type="number" value="0..9999" length="4" first_zero="false"/> <!-- no zero -->
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
default        first_zero="false"
7701      →     7701
3494      →     3494
0785      →     2379
9597      →     9597
2078      →     2078
```

Only `0785` (the one value that started with a zero) is replaced by a full
four-digit `2379`; everything else already had no leading zero and is untouched.

- **Digit-string mode** (no `value`): a leading zero is **forbidden** by default.
  Pass `first_zero="true"` when the string is allowed to start with a zero (the
  ten-digit example above).

## Add and remove numbers: `include` / `exclude`

To carve a couple of holes out of a range without spelling out a list of
sub-ranges, use `exclude` (remove) and `include` (add). Values are numbers or
`a..b` ranges, comma-separated.

```xml
<gen type="number" value="0..9" exclude="3"/>               <!-- 0–9 except 3 -->
<gen type="number" value="1000..9999" exclude="1234,5678"/> <!-- ids minus two -->
<gen type="number" value="0..100" exclude="40..60"/>        <!-- without the middle -->
<gen type="number" value="0..9" include="100"/>             <!-- 0–9 and also 100 -->
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
value="0..9" exclude="3"               → 7
value="1000..9999" exclude="1234,5678" → 7931
value="0..100" exclude="40..60"        → 82
value="0..9" include="100"             → 8
```

Two things worth knowing:

- **The pick is genuinely uniform** over everything that remains. `value="0..9"
exclude="3"` gives each of the nine surviving numbers exactly a 1-in-9 chance —
  unlike a range list, where ranges, not numbers, are equally weighted.
- **A set has no decimals.** `include`/`exclude` build a set of whole numbers and pick one
  uniformly, so `decimals=` has nothing to round. The two together are refused (`TDC255`) —
  before that the engine dropped `decimals` and emitted integers without a word.
- **`exclude` has the last word.** The final set is `(base ∪ include) − exclude`,
  so a number added by `include` and removed by `exclude` is gone. If nothing is
  left after the modifiers, that's error `TDC087`.

These modifiers need a **range** `value`; they don't apply to the digit-string
(`length`-only) mode.

## Gotchas, in one place

- Ranges use `..`, never `-` (a single `-` is a minus sign).
- Leading-zero width is preserved: `value="0000..9999"` → `"0034"`.
- Digit-string mode returns **text**, not a number — safe for huge ids.
- In a range list, ranges are uniform, not the individual numbers — use `exclude`
  for a uniform pick with holes.
