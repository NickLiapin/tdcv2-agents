# The `pattern` generator

**Use it when** a signal has a shape you can't describe with a formula — demand by
hour, a demographic wave, a screenshot of a stock chart, any "wiggly" line. You
**draw the picture**, and its shape is **stretched across all rows**: the horizontal
axis is the row number (first … last), the vertical axis is the value. The drawing
can be tiny; the rows can number in the millions.

Nothing is pre-rendered into a file. The picture is read **when the run starts**, and
each row computes its own point on it, so a million rows cost no more memory than ten.

Example outputs below are illustrative and can differ slightly by core version; the
_shape_ is what's guaranteed.

## Why draw a shape instead of picking a distribution

Ready-made distributions (`normal`, `poisson`, …) have a **fixed** shape — a bell, a
decaying tail. A real signal often needs a shape that isn't in that list: two humps
where the **right one is taller**, a plateau with a spike at the end, demand that
rises toward noon and falls at night. You can't get "two humps of different heights"
out of `normal`. `pattern` removes that limit — you draw the silhouette yourself, and
it's stretched across the rows as-is.

## How to turn it on

Every [`<gen>`](../reference/generators.md) with `type="pattern"` takes exactly
**one** source of shape. The usual one is a **file** — draw in any editor, or
screenshot a chart, and hand the file over:

```xml
<!-- a drawing you made: SVG or PNG -->
<gen type="pattern" src="chart.svg" y_range="0..40"/>
```

For a shape simple enough to type, the same generator accepts points inline — a
single line with `points`, or a band with `upper` / `lower`:

```xml
<gen type="pattern" points="0,5  20,40  40,8  60,45  80,15  100,5" y_range="0..40"/>
<gen type="pattern" upper="0,20 50,40 100,20" lower="0,5 50,10 100,5" y_range="0..40"/>
```

| Attribute         | What it sets                                                                                                    |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src`             | An **SVG** or **PNG** file — the usual way to give the shape                                                    |
| `points`          | Pairs `x,y` typed inline instead of a file: `x` across, `y` height                                              |
| `upper` / `lower` | Two boundary curves typed inline — a [corridor](#a-drawing-is-read-column-by-column)                            |
| `mode`            | `signal` (default) — a trajectory; `density` — a [distribution](#mode--the-two-questions-you-can-ask-a-drawing) |
| `y_range`         | **Required.** `min..max` — what the drawing's canvas floor and ceiling become                                   |
| `fit`             | `low..high` — where a drawing read from `src` lands ([below](#fit--where-a-drawing-from-a-file-lands))          |
| `interp`          | `linear` (default) / `smooth` / `step` — how the line behaves between points                                    |
| `spread`          | Randomize every row by ±N in `y_range` units (default `0` — an exact line)                                      |
| `ink_threshold`   | `0..1` — how dark a PNG pixel must be to count as ink (default `0.5`)                                           |
| `decimals`        | Digits after the decimal point (default `0`)                                                                    |

## `src` — the picture is the config

Two formats are read, and both end up as the same thing internally — a vector
outline:

- **SVG** — read from its real geometry: `<path>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`,
  `<line>`, `<rect>` (rounded corners included), `<circle>`, `<ellipse>`. Bezier
  curves and arcs are followed as drawn, and `transform` on a shape or on any
  enclosing `<g>` is applied. Draw in Illustrator, Figma, Inkscape, or by hand —
  export and go. One rule tells the shapes apart: when a single line is being
  read, the primitives (`rect`, `circle`, `ellipse`) count as furniture — a
  chart export's frame and background — and anything actually drawn outranks
  them; in a band every shape counts, because the drawing is the region.
- **PNG with a transparent background** — the drawn pixels are the shape and the
  transparency is empty space. That's what a screenshot cropped to a chart, or a
  brush stroke exported from any raster editor, looks like. A PNG with a solid
  background falls back to darkness instead: dark pixels are ink, light ones are
  background, and `ink_threshold` moves the cutoff.

An SVG's `y` axis grows **downward**, the way every drawing program stores it. TDC
flips it, so "higher on the screen" always means "a larger value".

### A whole example, end to end

This is a real file — 240×140 pixels, a stroke on a transparent background and
nothing else. No axes, no labels, no frame: everything opaque in the file is read
as part of the drawing.

*line-input.png — the whole file. The white backing is only here so the stroke is visible; the file itself is transparent.*

```xml
<gen type="pattern" src="line-input.png" y_range="0..100"/>
```

Run it for 40 rows and plot the result against the drawing. The green dots are the
generated values; the orange line is the picture:

*Every row lands exactly on the stroke — a single line carries no randomness at all.*

- **drawn** — the line drawn in the file
- **made** — generated values (40 rows)

The picture is 240 px wide and the run is 40 rows, but neither number has to match
the other: ask for 40 rows or 4,000,000 and the same drawing is stretched across
them.

### The same thing from a vector file

An SVG is not approximated. This one is a single cubic Bezier inside a `<g>` that
flips the y axis — the two things a drawing program emits constantly:

*curve-input.svg — one path, one transform.*

*The curve is followed as drawn: the Bezier is walked, the transform applied, the y axis flipped back.*

- **drawn** — the Bezier from the file, with its transform applied
- **made** — generated values (40 rows)

## A drawing is read column by column

TDC never guesses whether your picture is "one line" or "a band". It **measures**,
and the measurement answers the question on its own.

For each column of the drawing it takes two readings: **from the top down** to the
first mark it meets, and **from the bottom up** to the first mark it meets.

*The same two readings, on a single line and on a band. Nothing else is inspected.*

- **A** — the readings meet on one pixel — the value is exact
- **B** — the readings stand apart — the value is random between them
- **mark** — the readings themselves: top-down and bottom-up

- Both readings land on the **same** spot → that column is an **exact point** on the
  graph. Every row that falls there gets that one value, with no randomness.
- The readings land **apart** → that column is a **band**. A row falling there gets a
  random value between the two edges, fixed by the [`seed`](../core-concepts/determinism.md).

So a picture with two strokes is a **corridor**, and each row picks a random value
between them. Here is the input file and 300 rows generated from it:

*tunnel-input.png — two strokes, nothing else.*

*Every value lands inside the band. Where the band is wide the spread is wide; where it narrows, so does the data.*

- **band** — the band drawn in the file
- **made** — generated values (300 rows)
- **A** — one column: the value is taken between its edges

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **One picture can be both.** A line that runs alone and then splits into two
  branches gives exact values while it's a single stroke, and random ones once it
  opens up — no attribute needed, no mode to pick.
- **Anything closed is a corridor.** Draw a car, a leaf, a blob: it has a top edge
  and a bottom edge, so it reads as a band between them. That is not a figure of
  speech — here is a car:

*car-input.png — a silhouette, painted solid.*

*The values fill the body between its top and bottom edges — and where the drawing is a single line (the ground before and after the car), they collapse to one exact value.*

- **band** — the drawn car
- **made** — generated values (300 rows)
- **A** — a wheel lowers the bottom edge of the body
- **B** — the ground before and after the car is a single line, so the values are exact

Here's a line that runs flat and then forks — one branch up, one branch down:

*split-input.png — a single stroke that becomes two.*

*Before the fork every row gets the same exact value; after it, a random one inside the widening band.*

- **drawn** — the lines from the file
- **made** — generated values (60 rows)
- **A** — the line forks here
- **B** — before the fork — the same exact value every time
- **C** — after it — random inside the widening band

The same run on two different seeds shows it plainly — the first half is identical,
the second half is not:

`./run split.tdc (11 rows, two seeds)`

```
seed A:  50  50  50  50  50  50  44  47  66  18  45
seed B:  50  50  50  50  50  51  57  61  60  81  35
```

### Typing a corridor inline: two attributes, never one string

A corridor drawn in a file needs no attributes at all — two strokes in the picture
already read as two edges. Typed inline it needs **two attributes**, `upper` and
`lower`, one curve each:

```xml
<gen type="pattern" upper="0,80 100,80" lower="0,20 100,20" y_range="0..100"/>
```

The tempting shorthand — one `points` with a separator between the two lines —
does not exist, and a `;` is refused rather than ignored:

`tdcv2 check corridor.tdc`

```
error[TDC285]: pattern: ";" does not separate two lines in points= — every number is read as one curve. For a band, draw the two edges separately: upper="0,80 100,80" lower="0,20 100,20".
```

The same check catches a drawing with **no width** — every point on the same `x`:

`tdcv2 check flat.tdc`

```
error[TDC285]: pattern: every point sits at x=50, so the drawing has no width and a card has nothing to read across. Give the points at least two different x coordinates.
```

Both are reported by [`check`](../reference/cli.md) as well as by the run: `points`,
`upper` and `lower` are read before a single row exists, by the same code the run
uses.

## `y_range` — the scale, and it is required

A drawing carries **no scale of its own**. The same curve leaves one tool running
0..100, another 0..480, a third 0..10002345345, and none of those numbers mean
anything until you say what the axis is. `y_range="min..max"` is that statement, which
is why it is required rather than optional: without it every answer would be a guess
about somebody's export settings.

What it scales is the **canvas**, not the ink:

| the drawing came from        | canvas floor                         | canvas ceiling                       |
| :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| a **PNG**                    | bottom of the image                  | top of the image                     |
| a **vector** file (SVG)      | the drawing's own lowest point       | the drawing's own highest point      |
| `points` / `upper` / `lower` | `0`, grown down if you drew below it | `100`, grown up if you drew above it |

For a typed-in drawing the canvas is a **percentage board**: 0..100 by default, and it
only ever grows to hold what you drew outside it — it never shrinks. That is what makes
a flat line at 50 the _middle_ of whatever range you ask for. Measured against the ink
instead, that same line would be the highest thing present, and so the top.

The three rows differ because the three inputs carry different things. A PNG is exactly
as tall as it says it is, so its frame is a real canvas and whitespace above a stroke
genuinely lowers that stroke's values. A vector file carries no frame worth trusting —
most editors crop the `viewBox` to the artwork on export, and a cropped one cannot be
told apart from a deliberately tight one — so the drawing itself is measured, and
[`fit`](#fit--where-a-drawing-from-a-file-lands) is how you place it.

```xml
<gen type="pattern" points="0,0 50,100 100,0" y_range="0..40" decimals="1"/>
<gen type="pattern" points="0,0 50,100 100,0" y_range="-2..2" decimals="1"/>
```

`./run yrange.tdc (the same triangle, 11 rows)`

```
0..40    0.0   8.0   16.0   24.0   32.0   40.0   32.0   24.0   16.0   8.0   0.0
-2..2   -2.0  -1.2   -0.4    0.4    1.2    2.0    1.2    0.4   -0.4  -1.2  -2.0
```

Nothing leaves the range, whatever coordinates you drew in. Combine `y_range` with
`decimals` when you need continuous values rather than whole numbers.

*One drawing, three scales. The shape is identical; only the numbers on the axis change.*

- **drawn** — the same drawn triangle
- **made** — generated values (25 rows)

`y_range` always means **the range of the values you get**. In `mode="density"` the
value axis is the drawing's width rather than its height, so there the range is
stretched across the picture from left to right — the attribute keeps its meaning
even though the axis changes.

## `fit` — where a drawing from a file lands

A drawing carries a **shape**. It carries a **position** only if it also carries a
board — and a file exported from someone else's editor does not. Not the units, not the
origin, not even which way is up. So there are only two things about it that can be
measured: its own lowest point and its own highest point.

`fit="low..high"` says what those two become.

```xml
<gen type="pattern" src="foreign.svg" y_range="200..300" fit="255..297"/>
```

The lowest point of the drawing comes out as `255`, the highest as `297`, and nothing
in between can leave that band — whatever coordinates the file was drawn in, `0..1000`
or `-5..3e6`. The shape survives; the placement is what you declared.

Leave `fit` out and the drawing **fills `y_range`**: lowest to the floor, highest to the
ceiling. That is a stated convention rather than a guess — it invents no information.

|                   | canvas (what gets mapped) | `fit` absent              | `fit` present               |
| :---------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------ | :-------------------------- |
| a **vector** file | the drawing itself        | it fills `y_range`        | its ends land on the band   |
| a **PNG**         | the image frame           | the frame fills `y_range` | the frame lands on the band |

Under `mode="density"` it follows the same axis `y_range` does. There the value axis is
the drawing's **width**, not its height, so `fit` places its left and right edge instead
of its lowest and highest point. `fit` is simply a narrower `y_range` for a drawing read
from `src` — it changes axis exactly where `y_range` changes axis, and never separately.

`fit` is **refused beside `points` / `upper` / `lower`** ([`TDC300`](../reference/errors.md)).
A typed point is already a percentage of the 0..100 board — `80` means 80% of `y_range` —
so there is nothing left to place, and writing both would be a config saying two things
at once.

### A corridor drawn in a file needs it

Two strokes in one file are a corridor, and a band measured against itself is always the
whole band. So without `fit` a banded SVG fills `y_range` — correct by the rule above,
and rarely what you wanted. `fit` carries in the config exactly what the typed spelling
carries in its numbers:

```xml
<gen type="pattern" upper="0,80 100,80" lower="0,60 100,60" y_range="0..100" decimals="1"/>
<gen type="pattern" src="band.svg" y_range="0..100" fit="60..80" decimals="1"/>
```

```
typed   62.3  62.5  73.4  76.0  71.7  75.0  61.3  64.3
drawn   62.3  62.5  73.4  76.0  71.7  75.0  61.3  64.3
```

Digit for digit, and the same in all five implementations — the pair is a shared fixture.

> [!NOTE]
> **Higher on the picture means larger in value**
>
> SVG counts `y` **downward** — the top of the file is `y=0`. The engine flips it, so what
> looks higher in your editor comes out larger in the data. You never write this down; it
> is worth knowing when a drawing comes out upside down and you are checking the file.

## `decimals` — digits after the point

`decimals` sets how many fractional digits each value keeps (default `0`, i.e. whole
numbers). Reach for it when the curve feeds a price, a temperature, or any measured
quantity where rounding to integers would flatten the shape.

```xml
<gen type="pattern" points="0,0 50,100 100,0" y_range="-1..1" decimals="2"/>
```

`./run decimals.tdc (11 rows)`

```
-1.00   -0.60   -0.20   0.20   0.60   1.00   0.60   0.20   -0.20   -0.60   -1.00
```

The middle row sits on the apex and reads `1.00`, because that is where its line crosses
the drawing. [Stretching](#stretching--the-drawing-rarely-has-as-many-points-as-you-have-rows),
below, is that rule in full.

## Stretching — the drawing rarely has as many points as you have rows

Row `i` of `count` reads the drawing at `t = i / (count − 1)`, and its value is **where
its own vertical line crosses the line you drew**. Ten rows are ten crossings; you can
check them on the picture with a ruler. There is no second rule underneath.

**More drawn detail than rows → you get the crossings, not a summary.** A five-tooth
zigzag squeezed into five rows reports the five places those rows land, each of which is
a real point of the zigzag:

```xml
<gen type="pattern" points="0,0 10,100 20,0 30,100 40,0 50,100 60,0 70,100 80,0 90,100 100,0"
     y_range="0..100"/>
```

`./run saw.tdc (5 teeth into 5 rows)`

```
0   50   100   50   0
```

Widen the same run to 40 rows and the teeth come through, because now the rows are close
enough together to land on them: `0  26  51  77  97  72  46  21  5  31  56  82 …`

Missing a peak that falls between two rows is not a lost measurement — it is what asking
for five rows means. Draw in more detail, or ask for more rows: at a million rows the
same drawing spells itself out completely, every peak included. The point of the rule is
that you can look at your own drawing beforehand and say what will come out.

*The same zigzag. With rows to spare, every tooth comes through; with seven rows, each one reads the place its own line crosses the drawing, and the teeth in between are simply not among the seven readings asked for.*

- **drawn** — the drawn zigzag
- **made** — generated values
- **A** — 300 rows — the teeth come through
- **B** — 7 rows — seven crossings, and the rest fall between them

**More rows than drawn points → interpolation**, which is where `interp` comes in.

## `interp` — how the line behaves between two drawn points

Between two points drawn far apart there may be thousands of rows. Left alone, a
straight segment climbs by exactly the same amount every row — mathematically
correct and visibly synthetic. `interp` picks the behavior:

| Value              | What it does                                                             |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `linear` (default) | Straight segments — a constant rate between two points                   |
| `smooth`           | A curve through the points that **eases in and out**, never overshooting |
| `step`             | Holds each point's value until the next one — a staircase                |

`smooth` uses a monotone cubic: it rounds the corners and varies the rate, but it can
never take the line above or below the values you actually drew, so no phantom peak
appears out of a bend. The same three-point drawing over 11 rows:

`./run kink.tdc (11 rows, three modes)`

```
linear:  0   8  16  24  32  40  52  64  76  88  100
smooth:  0   8  15  23  31  40  50  62  75  88  100
step:    0   0   0   0   0  40  40  40  40  40  100
```

Note where `step` ends. A staircase holds each point's value in the band to its
**right**, and the last point has no band — the drawing stops there. So the last point
is read at the one place every run visits: the right edge itself, where the final row's
line crosses it. All three modes agree there, on the last thing you drew.

On a drawing with real corners the three are unmistakable — the dashed line is what
was drawn, the dots are what came out:

*linear rides the polyline exactly; smooth rounds every corner without ever leaving the drawn range; step holds each point until the next.*

- **dash** — what was drawn: a polyline through five points
- **made** — generated values (41 rows)

Look at the step sizes: `linear` repeats `8, 8, 8, 8` — perfectly predictable.
`smooth` goes `8, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13` — it leaves the point gently, accelerates,
and arrives gently.

## `spread` — turn one line into a tunnel

`spread="N"` randomizes every row by **±N**, in the units of your `y_range`. Default
`0`: the line is exact and 100% predictable. Set it, and the drawn line becomes the
**center of a band** — so you don't have to draw both edges of a corridor just to get
some wobble.

It follows whatever scale you declared: on `y_range="0..100"` a spread of `1` is one
point of noise; on `y_range="0..1"` you'd write `spread="0.001"` for the same
relative effect.

```xml
<gen type="pattern" src="ramp.svg" y_range="0..100" spread="5"/>
```

`./run ramp.tdc (11 rows)`

```
spread 0, seed A:   0  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90  100
spread 5, seed A:   5  13  16  29  37  52  57  69  83  86   99
spread 5, seed B:   5  11  21  26  45  53  64  73  82  94   99
```

The single stroke of `line-input.png` again, this time with `spread="6"`:

*One drawn line, a tunnel you never drew. The shape is untouched; each row just sits somewhere within ±6 of it.*

- **dash** — the drawn line — the center
- **band** — the ±6 corridor you never drew
- **made** — generated values (60 rows)

The trend is untouched; each row just sits somewhere inside ±5 of it. Like the
corridor, the scatter is **deterministic** — the same seed reproduces it exactly.
`spread` also works on a drawing that is already a band: it widens the band by `N` on
both sides.

## `ink_threshold` — the dark/light cutoff for PNGs

When a PNG has a solid background, ink is decided by darkness. `ink_threshold` is the
cutoff on a `0..1` scale (default `0.5`): a pixel counts as ink when it is **at or
darker than** the cutoff. So **raise** it toward `1` to take in faint, anti-aliased
edges and light gray, and **lower** it toward `0` to keep only near-black strokes. It
has no effect on a PNG drawn on transparency, where the alpha channel already says what
is drawn.

```xml
<gen type="pattern" src="faint-curve.png" ink_threshold="0.8" y_range="0..100"/>
```

This file has two strokes on a white canvas — one black, one light gray — and the
threshold decides whether the gray one exists at all:

*threshold-input.png — two strokes on an opaque canvas.*

*At the default cutoff the gray stroke is background and the reading is a single exact line. Raise the cutoff and gray counts as ink too — now there are two edges, so the values fall randomly between them.*

- **drawn** — the black stroke
- **faint** — the light gray stroke
- **made** — generated values (60 rows)

## The signal is a trajectory, not a histogram

A row's value is the curve's height **at its position in order**. So the numbers come
out **along** the curve, like the trail of a pen — a **trajectory**, not "a pile of
values". If you took those same numbers and, ignoring their order, built a
**histogram** (how often each value occurs), it would **not** reproduce the curve's
shape. Here's the real histogram of a two-hump drawing over 300 rows:

`./run humps.tdc --count 300 | histogram`

```

No two humps — the histogram is nearly flat. That's not a bug: the signal **passes
through** each height about equally often, so the pile of its values doesn't look
like the drawing. When you want the drawing to set **frequency** instead, that's the
other reading — `mode="density"`, below.

## `mode` — the two questions you can ask a drawing

The same picture answers two different questions, and `mode` picks which one:

| Mode               | The question                             | What comes out                                                               |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `signal` (default) | "what value does **this row** get?"      | `0, 20, 40, 70, 90, 100, 90, 70, 40, 20, 0` — walks along the line, in order |
| `density`          | "how **often** does this value come up?" | a pile of numbers clustered around the drawn hump, in random order           |

In `density` the axes swap meaning: the horizontal axis is the **value**, and the
curve's height is **how often** that value occurs. Draw a hump over the middle and
most numbers land in the middle; draw two humps of different heights and the taller
one gets proportionally more. It's "draw your own probability" instead of picking
`normal` / `poisson` off a list.

```xml
<!-- a triangle standing between x=25 and x=75 -->
<gen type="pattern" points="0,0 25,0 50,100 75,0 100,0" y_range="0..100" mode="density"/>
```

`./run density.tdc --count 6000 | histogram`

```

```

The values themselves come out shuffled — `60 57 36 49 48 40 67 53 …` — because a
distribution has no order. And nothing appears outside `25..75`: the drawing is flat
there, and a flat stretch means "never".

The same thing with a picture instead of typed points. Here is a hump drawn as a
filled shape:

*hump-input.png — a hump painted with a brush, saved on transparency.*

```xml
<gen type="pattern" src="hump-input.png" y_range="0..100" mode="density"/>
```

Generate 6,000 rows from it and count how often each value came up:

*Top: what was drawn. Bottom: how often each value actually came up. The horizontal axis is the same in both — and it is the value, not the row number.*

- **A** — what is drawn in the file
- **B** — histogram of 6000 generated values
- **C** — the height of the drawing here = how often that value comes up

That is the whole idea: the silhouette you paint becomes the histogram of the data.
No formula was chosen anywhere.

And the height is proportional, not just positional — draw one hump twice as tall as
the other and it takes about twice as many of the values:

*Two humps, the right one twice as tall. The histogram below reproduces both, in proportion.*

- **A** — what is drawn: two humps of different height
- **B** — histogram of 6000 generated values
- **C** — the left hump
- **D** — the right one, twice as tall — and twice as many values

Things worth knowing about `density`:

- **Zero is the picture's floor.** For a PNG that's the bottom edge of the image; for
  an SVG or inline points it's the lowest point of the drawing. Wherever the curve is
  at its lowest, that value never occurs — so bring your curve down to the baseline at
  the edges of the range you want.
- **A band contributes its top edge.** If the drawing is a corridor, the outline is
  what shapes the distribution.
- **`interp` still applies, and it moves real weight.** `smooth` gives a rounded
  distribution rather than a polygonal one — but if the drawing is a BAR CHART, one
  declared share per bar, use `interp="step"`. It is the only mode that holds a value
  across the whole bar; `linear` and `smooth` run a line THROUGH each point, so a peak
  bleeds into its neighbours. Measured on ten bars, 200,000 rows, a peak declared at
  40%: `step` kept the two centre bars at 28.4% and 27.9%, `smooth` concentrated them
  into 41.5% and 10.0%. Same points, different shares — the choice is not cosmetic.
- **`spread` is refused here.** The drawing is already the scatter, so combining the
  two is a mistake rather than a feature.
- **A flat drawing means "no preference"** and gives a uniform spread across the
  range instead of an error.
- **Deterministic and streamable** like everything else: the same seed reproduces the
  same pile, at any row count.

## Details

- **Deterministic:** where the drawing is a single line, a row's value is the
  height there (no randomness at all); where it is a band — or where `spread` is set
  — the scatter is fixed by the [`seed`](../core-concepts/determinism.md). Same seed
  and config → same result.
- **Any size, either engine:** each row is computed from its own number, so memory
  doesn't grow. A million rows from a small drawing is fine on the
  [streaming engines](../guides/large-outputs.md).
- **The file is read once,** at the start of the run, and turned into geometry — the
  cost doesn't scale with the row count.

## Check it by hand

A few one-liners to build intuition:

- `points="0,0 50,100 100,0" y_range="0..100"` — a triangle: values rise to the middle and fall.
- `points="0,10 90,10 100,100" y_range="0..100"` — a flat line with a spike only in the last 10% of rows.
- `upper="0,0 50,40 100,0" y_range="0..100"` — a band: random from `0` up to a central peak.
- `src="chart.png" y_range="0..100"` — a drawn shape becomes data along its outline.
- add `spread="2"` to any of them — the same shape, now with wobble.
- add `mode="density"` instead — the same shape now decides how **often** each value
  comes up.

The spike case makes the "position = row number" idea obvious:

`./run spike.tdc (20 rows)`

```
rows 1–18: 10   (the flat stretch)
row 19: 53      (climbing)
row 20: 100     (the spike)
```
