# The `regex` generator

**Use it when** a value has a **strict shape** — a phone number, a SKU, a license
plate, a token, an order code. There are too many possibilities for a list, and
too much internal structure for [`number`](number.md): letters, digits, and
separators in specific places.

A regular expression describes that shape. The generator reads it left to right and
fills each slot with random characters from the matching set, printing literals
(dashes, parentheses, `@`) as-is.

## A worked example

A US-format phone number:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="\+1 \([0-9]{3}\) [0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}"/>
```

`./run phone.tdc`

```
+1 (299) 994-1396
+1 (929) 818-7014
+1 (462) 860-3781
+1 (905) 009-2500
+1 (876) 318-9991
```

The parentheses, spaces, and dashes are literals (the backslash before `(` and `)`
makes them ordinary characters). The `\+1` is a literal `+1`, and the `[0-9]{…}`
groups are slots that get random digits. The shape is always the same; only the
values differ.

Every example on this page is rendered with `seed="demo"`. Two things decide the draw,
though, and the second one surprises people: the seed **and the sequence's name**. Each
column draws from its own stream, derived from both, so that adding a column never shifts
the ones beside it — which means the same pattern under `<sequence name="Phone">` and
under `<sequence name="V">` gives different strings, on the same seed. Copy a pattern out
of this page into a differently named sequence and expect different values.

Output values are illustrative; the exact strings can differ by core version, but the
shape never does.

Other everyday shapes:

| Task              | Pattern                             | Example                            |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| SKU               | `[A-Z]{3}-[0-9]{4}`                 | `SAH-0136`                         |
| Plate (US)        | `[0-9][A-Z]{3}[0-9]{3}`             | `7KLM042`                          |
| 32-char hex token | `[A-F0-9]{32}`                      | `5AE5ABF3F7040BEB966D65A23EB7C1EC` |
| Test email        | `user_[a-z0-9]{8}@test\.(com\|org)` | `user_zak0bdnw@test.com`           |

That same SKU, rendered in full:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="[A-Z]{3}-[0-9]{4}"/>
```

`./run sku.tdc`

## When plain `regex` is the right tool

Use `type="regex"` to describe the **shape of one string** when you don't need
exact proportions inside it. An alternation like `(com|org)` is chosen **randomly
and independently** on each row — fine when the exact split of variants doesn't
matter.

Good fits for plain `regex`:

- a technical ID: `[A-Z]{2}[0-9]{6}`
- a safe test email: `user_[a-z0-9]{8}@test\.(com|org)`
- a code with a repeating block: `([0-9]{3})-[A-Z]{2}-\1`
- a fixed-length token: `[A-F0-9]{32}`

If you need **exact shares** of variants inside the string (say, exactly 70% with
one prefix), plain `regex` won't do it — reach for
[`advanced_regex`](advanced-regex.md):

```xml
<gen type="advanced_regex" value="(?%{70:US;20:CA;10:UK})-[0-9]{6}"/>
```

The rest of this page is the same list, but with **real output** under each one.

## Character classes

`[…]` takes one random character from the set. A range `a-z` is shorthand for "every
letter from `a` to `z`".

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="[ABC]{6}"/>     <!-- only A, B, C -->
<gen type="regex" value="[a-z]{6}"/>     <!-- lowercase latin -->
<gen type="regex" value="[A-Z0-9]{6}"/>  <!-- uppercase and digits -->
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
[ABC]{6}      [a-z]{6}      [A-Z0-9]{6}
CAACAA        sahtbc        ZAK0BD
CCACAC        rvhyfr        Y3K7HY
AAABAC        ggaqby        IJBWC8
```

Each slot is chosen independently, so letters repeat in `[ABC]{6}` — it's six
separate random characters, not a draw without replacement.

## Shorthand classes — `\d` `\w` `\s`

Ready-made sets: `\d` is a digit `[0-9]`, `\w` is a letter/digit/`_`, `\s` is a space
or tab.

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="\d{6}"/>
<gen type="regex" value="\w{8}"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
\d{6}      \w{8}
702701     tBSvCGXm
682926     qyR7NqAz
220609     OQBoE7TG
```

`\s` is invisible in the output, so spaces and tabs are shown here as `<SP>` and
`<TAB>` (in real output they're ordinary whitespace):

<!-- doc-check: skip the whitespace is written out as <SP>/<TAB> so a reader can see it -->

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="A\sB\sC"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
A<TAB>B<TAB>C
A<SP>B<TAB>C
A<SP>B<SP>C
```

## Negated classes — `[^…]` `\D` `\W` `\S`

`[^0-9]` and `\D` give **any printable ASCII character except** the listed ones.
They're equivalent and produce the same output on the same seed:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="[^0-9]{6}"/>
<gen type="regex" value="\D{6}"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
[^0-9]{6}    \D{6}
f"Bi#)       f"Bi#)
cnAz<b       cnAz<b
@!"%zR       @!"%zR
```

The set is the **whole printable ASCII** range (letters, digits,
punctuation), not just letters. If you want letters only, spell it out: `[A-Za-z]`.

## Any character — `.`

The dot is one printable ASCII character (the same set as `\D`, with no exclusions):

```xml
<gen type="regex" value=".{8}"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
3|{Dy{JH
z9{Gl0mx
J^9Pp_%r
z!Tx'){i
```

## Quantifiers — how many times

`{n}` is exactly `n`; `{n,m}` is `n` to `m` (random); `?` is zero or one (so `AB?C`
is `AC` or `ABC`).

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="[A-Z]{4}"/>    <!-- exactly 4 -->
<gen type="regex" value="[A-Z]{2,5}"/>  <!-- 2 to 5 -->
<gen type="regex" value="AB?C"/>        <!-- B optional -->
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
[A-Z]{4}    [A-Z]{2,5}    AB?C
SAHT        SAHTB         ABC
RVHY        RVH           AC
GGAQ        GG            AC
```

Change the quantifier and the length changes — same "skeleton" (letters, then
digits), different size:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="[A-Z]{2}[0-9]{4}"/>   <!-- short -->
<gen type="regex" value="[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{8}"/>   <!-- long -->
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
[A-Z]{2}[0-9]{4}    [A-Z]{3}[0-9]{8}
SA7013              SAH01363846
RV9260              RVH26087805
GG6093              GGA09313068
```

## Alternation and groups — `|` `(…)` `(?:…)`

`cat|dog` picks one variant **at random** on each row. Parentheses group the
variants so you can attach a suffix or a quantifier.

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="cat|dog"/>            <!-- alternation -->
<gen type="regex" value="(cat|dog)-[0-9]{2}"/> <!-- group + suffix -->
<gen type="regex" value="(?:cat|dog)[0-9]"/>   <!-- no capture -->
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
cat|dog    (cat|dog)-[0-9]{2}    (?:cat|dog)[0-9]
dog        dog-02               dog7
cat        cat-82               cat6
cat        cat-20               cat2
dog        dog-77               dog2
```

A plain group `(…)` remembers its choice (capture) so you can refer back to it with
`\1`. `(?:…)` groups without remembering — use it when you don't need the capture.

> [!NOTE]
> **Random, not exact**
>
> `cat` and `dog` come out unevenly — this is a **random** choice, not exact
> proportions. For exactly 70/30, use [`advanced_regex`](advanced-regex.md).

## Anchors — `^` `$`

`^` (start) and `$` (end) are zero-width: the generator accepts them but they add
nothing to the output. `^[A-Z]{3}$` produces the same three letters as `[A-Z]{3}`:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="^[A-Z]{3}$"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
FZY
YHZ
LRG
```

## Escaping

Turn a regex metacharacter into an ordinary literal with `\`:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="\.\+\(\)\[\]\{\}\\"/>
```

The generated string is constant here (there are no random slots):

`./run demo.tdc`

```
.+()[]{}\
```

Inside a character class, a dash is a literal when it's first or last — then it's
just the character `-`, not a range:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="[-A-C]{8}"/>
<gen type="regex" value="[A-C-]{8}"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
[-A-C]{8}    [A-C-]{8}
B-AB--AB     CABCAABC
BCAC-B-C     C-B-ACA-
-A-B-CA-     ABACA-BA
```

The set here is four characters: `A`, `B`, `C`, and `-`.

## Unicode alphabets

Character classes aren't limited to ASCII. The same machinery accepts any Unicode
BMP range and any built-in **named alphabet**, so the generator localizes without
special cases. Start with the Latin script most data needs — a plain range covers
Western European accented letters directly:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="[a-zà-ÿ]{8}"/>  <!-- latin + accents -->
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
lþýwüýzy
ýpþyôkõü
zìpãöídø
```

The examples below are a deliberate **Unicode/localization demonstration** —
non-Latin scripts written exactly the same way. Plain BMP ranges work directly
inside a character class:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="[а-я]{8}"/>   <!-- cyrillic -->
<gen type="regex" value="[א-ת]{6}"/>   <!-- hebrew -->
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
[а-я]{8}      [א-ת]{6}
цайчбглу      ףאחפבג
хщиюжхаъ      עץחשוע
зибфвюкг      זחאסבש
```

For real configs, named alphabets are clearer — they're documented, validated by
name, and can include characters that are awkward to express as a range (like the
Russian `ё`):

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="\a{cyrillic.ru.letters}{10}"/>
<gen type="regex" value="\a{kana.hiragana}{8}"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
\a{cyrillic.ru.letters}{10}    \a{kana.hiragana}{8}
нБСпВЖЧжХч                     まぃすめいおちふ
куСьНкАупф                     ほゆすをこぺあょ
```

You can mix alphabets inside one class — the character is then drawn from the union
of them:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="[\a{arabic.letters}\a{hebrew.letters}]{6}"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
خררػקר
קسרؾםح
ؿדسلנה
```

The escape `\a{name}` is one character from that alphabet, and it behaves like any
other atom — repeat it with `{n}` or `{n,m}`; inside a class it adds the whole
alphabet to the set. The full list of names is on the
[Symbol](symbol.md#named-alphabets-with-alphabet) page.

> [!NOTE]
> Negated classes (`[^...]`), `\D`, `\W`, `\S`, and `.` invert against the printable
> **ASCII** set only. For Unicode, spell out a positive set with `\a{name}`.

## Backreferences

A backreference ties parts of a string together: `\1` repeats what the first group
`(…)` already generated.

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="([0-9]{3})-[A-Z]{2}-\1"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
299-YZ-299
929-UE-929
462-VR-462
905-BC-905
```

The first and last three digits **always match** — that's the captured block. This
is how you build document numbers in which one section repeats.

A reference may only point to a group that was already generated to its left; a
forward reference is an error:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="\1([0-9]{3})"/>
```

`./run bad.tdc`

```
error: invalid regex generator pattern: backreference "\1" points to
a group that is not generated yet
```

If the capture sits inside a repetition, the backreference uses the **last** value
that group generated:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="([A-Z]){3}-\1"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
FZY-Y
YHZ-Z
LRG-G
```

Here `([A-Z]){3}` runs the group three times, and `\1` echoes only the third letter
it produced.

## Named groups — `(?<name>…)`

A group can carry a name, and `\k<name>` repeats it. It is the same group `\1` repeats —
a name is a second way to reach a group, not a second group:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="(?<code>[A-Z]{2})-[0-9]{3}-\k<code>"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
FZ-399-FZ
YH-481-YH
LR-586-LR
YA-900-YA
```

A name makes a long pattern readable, and it is what a conditional reads. Three rules:

- A name starts with a letter or `_` and holds letters, digits and `_`.
- **A name is used once.** Two groups under one name would make `\k<name>` a coin toss
  between them, settled by whichever the parser recorded last.
- `\k<name>` may only name a group that has already closed — the rule `\1` follows.

`(?<=…)` and `(?<!…)` are still lookbehind and still refused. Neither is a group whose
name begins with `=`.

## Conditionals — `(?(name)yes|no)`

A conditional asks whether a group produced anything and writes one branch or the other.
It is how you add a separator only when there is something to separate:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="(?<area>0[1-9]{2})?(?(area)-|8 )[0-9]{4}"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
099-9944
039-8189
063-8608
016-0097
8 7683
8 0194
```

The area code is optional. Where it appears a `-` follows it; where it does not, the row
starts `8 ` instead. Without a conditional that is two configs, or a `<switch>`.

- **The conditional draws nothing.** It reads a decision the group already made, so adding
  one to a pattern leaves every other value in the column exactly where it was.
- The second branch may be left out: `(?(area)-)` writes the `-` or nothing at all.
- A group can be tested by number too — `([0-9]{3})?(?(1)-)`.
- **Two branches, no more.** A third is refused rather than quietly dropped; for a choice
  inside a branch, group it: `(?(area)(?:x|y)|z)`.

A conditional may only test a group to its left, for the reason a backreference may only
point to one — the group has produced nothing yet, so the branch could never be taken:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="(?(area)-)(?<area>[0-9]{3})"/>
```

`./run bad.tdc`

```
error: invalid regex generator pattern: conditional group "(?(area)...)"
tests group "area", which is not generated yet
```

## The length guard — `regex_max_length`

Every result is checked against
[`regex_max_length`](../reference/attributes.md) (default **32**). A pattern that
could exceed it is rejected **before** generation:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="[A-Z0-9]{40}"/>
```

`./run token.tdc`

```
error: invalid regex generator pattern: regex can produce 40 characters,
which exceeds regex_max_length=32
```

Raise the cap for the whole config on `<tdc>`. Use this when a config has several
long patterns and you want one place to set the ceiling:

```xml
<tdc regex_max_length="64">
    <env count="5" seed="demo">
        <sequence name="Token"><gen type="regex" value="[A-Z0-9]{40}"/></sequence>
    </env>
    <block>
        <line><data>${{Token}}</data></line>
    </block>
</tdc>
```

`./run token.tdc`

```
MURI40FXS16A2ABROOBQFGMSDBLWP3TCDTA16VVK
NPJ3PVSU1NGARTRDQHT92IHGWJZVUST4531IOEAW
66WWVKTAA2XWUQJBJA8P0SNZ6W3Q75R3CP12JIXW
```

Or set it **locally**, on just this one generator, when a single field is the
exception and you don't want to loosen the ceiling everywhere else:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="[A-Z0-9]{40}" regex_max_length="40"/>
```

`./run token.tdc`

```
H88N88QPEO7XQU8Y3HSZVUVHBRNYDL22R5UYULFK

PXJS4YC5M13GUWUS7BVTYLT6Y3YFXOC04TLQUFZF
```

`regex_max_length` does **not** make an infinite regex finite — it only allows an
already-finite result to be longer.

## What's not allowed

| Not allowed            | Why                                    | Use instead                     |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| `*`                    | No upper bound                         | `{0,n}`                         |
| `+`                    | No upper bound                         | `{1,n}`                         |
| `{n,}`                 | No upper bound                         | `{n,m}`                         |
| Lazy `*?`, `??`        | Matcher semantics, not generation      | Write the range you want        |
| Lookahead / lookbehind | Inspects existing text, doesn't build  | Move the condition into the DSL |
| `\p{...}` / `\P{...}`  | Unicode properties aren't portable yet | `\a{name}` or an explicit class |
| `\n` / `\r`            | Multi-line generation lives elsewhere  | Use separate `<line>`s          |

For example, `+` is rejected immediately:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="[a-z]+"/>
```

`./run bad.tdc`

```
error: invalid regex generator pattern: unbounded "+" quantifier is not
allowed; use "{1,n}"
```

## Unique values — `uniq="true"`

A pattern is always finite — `*`, `+` and `{n,}` are not allowed — so it can be counted, and
`uniq="true"` on its sequence gives every row a different string:

```xml
<sequence name="Plate" uniq="true">
    <gen type="regex" value="[A-Z]{2}-[0-9]{4}"/>
</sequence>

The count comes from the pattern's shape: a class counts its characters, a sequence
multiplies, `|` adds, and `{m,n}` adds up every length it allows. `[A-Z]{2}-[0-9]{4}` is
26² · 10⁴ = 6 760 000 plates; ask for more rows than that and the run is refused before
anything is drawn, naming both numbers. Within the count, the draw is simply taken again
whenever it lands on a plate already given out.

A pattern whose length varies runs out of its short forms first. `{2,10}` picks each of its
nine lengths one time in nine, so `[0-9]{2,10}` asked for 200 000 unique values gives out all
hundred two-digit strings and all thousand three-digit ones, and the rest of the column is
longer. Uniqueness bends the length mix; it does not refuse the request.

Where one string can be reached two ways — `(a|ab)(c|bc)` makes `abc` along both — the count
is high, and a request close to it can outrun the strings that really exist. The draw notices
the repeats piling up and stops with the reason rather than looping.

## Exact proportions

Plain `regex` doesn't set percentages inside the expression — `(cat|dog)` is random,
not "exactly 70/30". For exact shares, use:

- [`<mix percent="…">`](../reference/tags.md) to pick between DSL fragments
- [`<gen type="text" percent="…">`](text.md) for a set of values
- [`advanced_regex`](advanced-regex.md) for weighted choice right inside the pattern
