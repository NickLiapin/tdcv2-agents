# `running` — a total that carries down the column

**Use it when** a value is not drawn but _accumulated_: an account balance after each
transaction, a meter that only goes up, the largest load seen so far. Row 40's value
depends on rows 1 to 39.

Every other generator answers a row from its own index. This one cannot, and that is not
a limitation to work around — it is what "running" means.

```xml
<tdc>
  <env count="8" seed="ledger" local="en">
    <sequence name="Op"><gen type="number" value="-400..500"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Balance"><gen type="running" of="Op" accumulate="sum" base="1000"/></sequence>
  </env>
  <block>
    <line><data>${{Op}}   ${{Balance}}</data></line>
  </block>
</tdc>
```

`./run ledger.tdc`

## At a glance

| Attribute    | Required | What it does                                                       |
| :----------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `of`         | yes      | The column to accumulate. Must be **declared above** this sequence |
| `accumulate` | yes      | `sum`, `min` or `max`                                              |
| `base`       | no       | The opening value — an opening balance, a starting odometer        |
| `reset`      | no       | A column whose change restarts the total                           |

A running total **draws nothing**. It reads a column that already exists, consumes no
randomness at all, and therefore adding one leaves every other column exactly where it
was.

## `reset=` — one total per group

Without `reset=` there is one total for the whole file. With it, the column is split into
segments and each is accumulated on its own — a balance per account rather than a balance
per run.

```xml
<env count="9" seed="acct" local="en">
    <sequence name="Account"><gen type="text" value="A,A,A,B,B,C,C,C,C" order="sequential"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Op"><gen type="number" value="10..99" decimals="2"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Balance"><gen type="running" of="Op" accumulate="sum" reset="Account"/></sequence>
</env>
```

`./run accounts.tdc`

```
A  49.86  49.86
A  21.54  71.40
A  35.12  106.52
B  80.60  80.60
B  98.09  178.69
C  33.58  33.58
C  23.09  56.67
C  72.74  129.41
C  94.78  224.19
```

`base=` is the opening value of **each segment**, not of the run: with `reset=`, every
group starts from it again — which is what a per-account opening balance wants.

A segment ends when `reset=`'s value **changes from the previous row**, so the groups have
to be contiguous. `order="sequential"` above is one way to get that; sorting is another —
though [the database usually does the sorting](../constructs/overview.md), so the common
case is a column that already comes out grouped.

## Exact decimals

The arithmetic runs on whole numbers scaled by the widest fraction in the column, never on
floating point. `49.86 + 21.54` is `71.40` — and it is the same `71.40` in all five
implementations, which a float would not guarantee.

`base=` joins that scale. An opening `1000.00` widens the whole column to two decimals,
which is what a reader of a ledger expects.

## Declaration order

`of=` and `reset=` both name a column, and both must be **declared above** the running
total (`TDC240`). The reason is the same one [`parent`](../guides/hierarchical-dependencies.md)
has: the total is built out of a column that already exists.

`./run ledger.tdc`

```
error[TDC240]: of="Op" is not a sequence declared above this one
 --> ledger.tdc:3:54
  |
3 |     <sequence name="Balance"><gen type="running" of="Op" accumulate="sum"/></sequence>
  |                                                      ^^

note: A running total is built from a column that already exists, so the column it reads has to come first.
```

A running total that does not say what or how to accumulate is `TDC239`.

A running total is a **whole column** — each row carries every row before it — so it has to be
a `<sequence>` of its own. Inside a `<case>`, as one of the `<gen if="…">` branches, or as a part
or a field of a composed sequence it is refused with `TDC295`: a branch holds some rows and not
others, and a total over "the rows this branch happened to get" is not a number anyone asked
for. Build the total as its own sequence above, and use it by name where you need it.

## Which engine runs it

The [streaming engines](../guides/large-outputs.md) refuse a running total, by name, and
the router sends the config to the in-memory one:

`./run ledger.tdc --engine 2`

```
tdcv2: a running total ("Balance") is the accumulation of every row before it, so it cannot be computed one row at a time; the in-memory engine handles it (run without a forced streaming engine)
```

You normally never see that message — the router picks the engine itself, and the refusal
only surfaces when a config _names_ a streaming engine and so has asked to be told.

What it costs: a running total is held in memory for the run, like any in-memory column.
That is the honest boundary of this generator. A ledger of a few million rows is fine; a
billion-row ledger is not something TDC does, because the whole point of the streaming
engines is that a row can be computed from its index, and here it cannot.

**Everything else still streams.** The limit is per config, not per project: a run without
a running total is untouched, and the [running total inside one
record](../constructs/multiple-values.md#accumulate--a-running-total-across-the-list)
— `accumulate=` on a `repeat` list — costs nothing at all and works on every engine.
