# `stat` — one number for the whole run

**Use it when** a row needs to know something about _every_ row, including the ones after
it: is this price above the average, what is the largest order in the file, how many rows
carry a value at all.

This is the third and last axis of "a value that is not drawn but derived". `accumulate=`
totals a list inside one record. [`running`](running.md) totals a column as it goes, so
row 40 knows about rows 1–39. A statistic knows about all of them.

```xml
<tdc>
  <env count="8" seed="basket" local="en">
    <sequence name="Price"><gen type="number" value="10..200" decimals="2"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Average"><gen type="stat" of="Price" op="mean" decimals="2"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Verdict">
      <gen if="Price > Average" type="text" value="above average"/>
      <gen type="text" value="below average"/>
    </sequence>
  </env>
  <block>
    <line><data>${{Price}}   ${{Average}}   ${{Verdict}}</data></line>
  </block>
</tdc>
```

`./run basket.tdc`

```
156.83   122.52   above average
176.51   122.52   above average
135.17   122.52   above average
157.94   122.52   above average
50.71   122.52   below average
92.28   122.52   below average
50.37   122.52   below average
160.35   122.52   above average
```

"Is this row above average" cannot be asked any other way. The average is not knowable
until the last row exists, and a conditional `<gen>` is evaluated while the row is being
built — so the statistic has to be a column of its own, computed first.

## At a glance

| Attribute  | Required | What it does                                                                 |
| :--------- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `of`       | yes      | The column to summarise. Must be **declared above** this sequence            |
| `op`       | yes      | `sum`, `mean`, `median`, `min`, `max`, `count` or `stddev`                   |
| `decimals` | no       | Round the answer to N places, 0–10                                           |

A statistic **draws nothing**. It reads a column that already exists, consumes no
randomness at all, and therefore adding one leaves every other column exactly where it was.

## The seven statistics

```xml
<env count="6" seed="lab" local="en">
    <sequence name="Reading"><gen type="number" value="1..100"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Total"><gen type="stat" of="Reading" op="sum"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Smallest"><gen type="stat" of="Reading" op="min"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Largest"><gen type="stat" of="Reading" op="max"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Middle"><gen type="stat" of="Reading" op="median"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Spread"><gen type="stat" of="Reading" op="stddev" decimals="3"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Rows"><gen type="stat" of="Reading" op="count"/></sequence>
</env>
```

`./run lab.tdc`

```
60  sum=297 min=7 max=81 median=63 sd=27.415 n=6
81  sum=297 min=7 max=81 median=63 sd=27.415 n=6
66  sum=297 min=7 max=81 median=63 sd=27.415 n=6
7  sum=297 min=7 max=81 median=63 sd=27.415 n=6
17  sum=297 min=7 max=81 median=63 sd=27.415 n=6
66  sum=297 min=7 max=81 median=63 sd=27.415 n=6
```

Two of them are worth stating outright, because the alternatives are just as common and
give different numbers:

- **`stddev` is the POPULATION standard deviation** — divided by _n_, not by _n_−1. A
  generated column is the whole of what it describes, not a sample drawn from something
  larger, so _n_ is the honest divisor. The same choice the `stddev()`
  [expression function](../reference/expressions.md) makes.
- **`median` on an even count is the average of the two middle values**, so a column of
  `2,4,4,4,5,5,7,9` has median `4.5`.

`count` is how many rows carried a value — rows a [`parent`](../guides/hierarchical-dependencies.md)
filter emptied are not counted, and take no part in any of the others either. That is the
same rule `accumulate=` and `running` follow, so a filtered column means one thing across
all three rather than three.

Every op but `count` is arithmetic, so it needs numbers. A column holding a word is refused,
naming the column and the first cell that is not a number, rather than printing `NaN` on every
row. A number here is what the running total reads as one: digits, an optional sign and an
optional fraction. `count` counts any cell.

## Exact decimals, and `decimals=`

`sum`, `min` and `max` are the last value of the corresponding **running** column. That is
not a shortcut — it is what keeps the two features from drifting: the arithmetic runs on
whole numbers scaled by the widest fraction in the column, never on floating point, so
`19.99 + 0.01 + 0.01` is `20.01` in all five implementations rather than
`20.009999999999998` in one of them. `min` and `max` return an element that already exists,
so a value that arrived as `007` stays `007`.

`mean`, `median` and `stddev` are **ratios** and cannot be exact. Without `decimals=` they
print in full, digits and all, because a mean that quietly lost digits is worse than an
ugly one. With it they are rounded — and a half goes **away from zero**, the same rule
`round()` follows everywhere else in TDC, so `117.045` at two places is `117.05`.

## Declaration order

`of=` names a column, and it must be **declared above** the statistic (`TDC240`) — the same
rule [`parent`](../guides/hierarchical-dependencies.md) and `running` follow, for the same
reason: the statistic is built out of a column that already exists.

A statistic that does not say what to summarise, or which statistic to take, is `TDC262`.

A statistic is a **whole column** — it reads every row of the run — so it has to be a
`<sequence>` of its own. Inside a `<case>`, as one of the `<gen if="…">` branches, or as a part or
a field of a composed sequence it is refused with `TDC295`. Take the statistic as its own
sequence above, and read it by name where you need it.

`./run lab.tdc`

```
error[TDC262]: op="men" is not one of sum, mean, median, min, max, count, stddev

  |                                                               ^^^

help: did you mean "mean"?
note: One of: sum, mean, median, min, max, count, stddev.
```

## Which engine runs it

The [streaming engine](../guides/large-outputs.md) refuses a statistic, by name, and the
router sends the config to the in-memory one:

`./run basket.tdc --engine 2`

```
tdcv2: a statistic ("Average") is computed over every row of the run, including the ones after this one, so it cannot be computed one row at a time; the in-memory engine handles it (run without a forced streaming engine)
```

You normally never see that message — the router picks the engine itself, and the refusal
only surfaces when a config _names_ a streaming engine and so has asked to be told.

What it costs is the same boundary [`running`](running.md#which-engine-runs-it) has, one
step stronger: a running total at least knows its answer by the time it reaches a row,
while a statistic does not know it until the run is over. The column it reads is held for
the run.

> A statistic is the right tool when a row has to know about EVERY row. When it only has

**Everything else still streams.** The limit is per config, not per project: a run without
a statistic is untouched.
