# The `symbol` generator

**Use it when** you need a string of a given length built from a specific set of
**characters** — a token, a coupon code, a random suffix, or "noise" in a
particular script. `symbol` picks **one character at a time** out of a set you
define. (For a whole **word** from a list, use [`text`](text.md) instead.)

You define the character set in **one of two** ways — never both at once:

- [`value`](#your-own-set-with-value) — spell out your own set, right here;
- [`alphabet`](#named-alphabets-with-alphabet) — name a built-in Unicode alphabet.

Then [`length`](#length) says how many characters to produce, and
[`include`](#extend-the-set-with-include) / [`exclude`](#trim-the-set-with-exclude)
tweak the set without rewriting it.

Example outputs on this page are illustrative — the exact characters depend on the
seed and can differ between core versions. The **rules** they demonstrate are
stable.

## At a glance

| Attribute  | Required       | What it does                                        |
| :--------- | :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `value`    | one of the two | Your own character set (literals + `[x-y]` ranges)  |
| `alphabet` | one of the two | Name of a built-in Unicode alphabet                 |
| `length`   | no             | String length; default `1`, maximum `1024`          |
| `include`  | no             | Add characters to the set (same grammar as `value`) |
| `exclude`  | no             | Remove characters from the set                      |

## Your own set with `value`

The simplest route: list the characters you want in `value`. No regular expressions
required — you write the set, `symbol` draws from it.

```xml
<gen type="symbol" value="ABCDEF" length="4"/>        <!-- literals -->
<gen type="symbol" value="[a-z]" length="6"/>         <!-- a range -->
<gen type="symbol" value="[A-Z0-9]" length="8"/>      <!-- two ranges in one group -->
<gen type="symbol" value="[a-f]xY[0-9]" length="5"/>  <!-- ranges + literals mixed -->
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
value="ABCDEF" length="4"      → CDFA
value="[a-z]" length="6"       → tqmboa
value="[A-Z0-9]" length="8"    → K7QW2ZP4
value="[a-f]xY[0-9]" length="5" → x3bYa
```

### The rules for a set

- **Literals** — just write the characters: `value="ABCDEF"` → the set
  `{A, B, C, D, E, F}`.
- **Ranges** — in square brackets: `[a-z]`, `[A-Z]`, `[0-9]`. You can put several
  ranges in one group: `[a-z0-9_]`.
- **Commas and spaces outside brackets are ignored** — they're there only for
  readability: `value="[a-f], [0-5]"` is the same set as `value="[a-f][0-5]"`. To
  use a comma or a space _as a character_, put it in brackets: `[,]`, `[ ]`.
- **Duplicates are removed; order is preserved.** `value="AABB"` is just `{A, B}`.

Characters from any language work — you're not limited to ASCII. See
[Named alphabets](#named-alphabets-with-alphabet) below for a shortcut to whole
scripts, and [Unicode scripts by hand](#unicode-scripts-by-hand) for typing them
directly.

> [!NOTE]
> **One character, not one word**
>
> `symbol` picks a single **character** at a time. To choose a whole **word** from a
> list, use [`text`](text.md): `<gen type="text" value="red,green,blue"/>`.

## Length

`length` sets how many characters to produce. It defaults to `1` and caps at
`1024`. Use it whenever you need a fixed-width token — a 6-digit code, a 32-char
key, and so on.

```xml
<gen type="symbol" value="[A-Z0-9]"/>            <!-- length omitted → 1 -->
<gen type="symbol" value="[A-Z0-9]" length="6"/>
<gen type="symbol" value="[A-Z0-9]" length="16"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
length omitted → K
length="6"     → Q7ZW2P
length="16"    → K7QW2ZP4M9RXB3TA
```

Only an **exact** length is supported here. If you need a variable-width string,
[`number`](number.md#variable-length) accepts length ranges and
groups; `symbol` does not.

## Extend the set with `include`

Rather than rewriting a whole set to add a few characters, hand them to `include`.
It uses the same grammar as `value` (literals and `[x-y]` ranges). This is most
useful with a **named alphabet**, which is otherwise fixed — for example, letters
plus digits for a login-style string.

```xml
<!-- your own letters, plus two specific digits -->
<gen type="symbol" value="[a-z]" include="2,4" length="8"/>

<!-- a named alphabet, extended with the digits it lacks -->
<gen type="symbol" alphabet="latin.lower" include="[0-9]" length="8"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
value="[a-z]" include="2,4" length="8"   → t2qm4boa
alphabet="latin.lower" include="[0-9]"   → k7qw2zp4
```

## Trim the set with `exclude`

The mirror image: `exclude` removes characters from the set. Use it to drop
look-alike characters from a code (no `O`/`0`, no `l`/`1`), or trimming a couple of
letters from a named alphabet.

```xml
<!-- letters and digits, minus the confusing pairs -->
<gen type="symbol" value="[A-Z0-9]" exclude="O0Il1" length="8"/>

<!-- letters, minus one vowel -->
<gen type="symbol" value="[a-z]" exclude="y" length="8"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
value="[A-Z0-9]" exclude="O0Il1" length="8" → K7QW2ZP4
value="[a-z]" exclude="y" length="8"        → tqmboade
```

### How `include` and `exclude` combine

The final set is `(base ∪ include) − exclude`, so **`exclude` has the last word**:
a character that is both added by `include` and removed by `exclude` will **not**
appear. If the set ends up empty after the modifiers, that's error `TDC099`.

```xml
<!-- 4 is included, then excluded → it loses; 2 survives -->
<gen type="symbol" value="[a-z]" include="2,4" exclude="4" length="8"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
uf2zkz2m
```

## Named alphabets with `alphabet`

**Use it when** you need a random string from a specific writing system — Cyrillic
for Russian-style logins, kana for Japanese test data, Arabic or Hebrew letters to
exercise right-to-left layout. Typing the Unicode range by hand (`[а-я]`) is
error-prone: you forget `ё`, or you get the boundary wrong. A named alphabet is
checked by name and contains exactly the right characters.

`alphabet` replaces `value` — you give a name from the registry, plus a `length`.

```xml
<gen type="symbol" alphabet="cyrillic.ru.letters" length="10"/>
<gen type="symbol" alphabet="kana.hiragana" length="8"/>
<gen type="symbol" alphabet="arabic.letters" length="6"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
cyrillic.ru.letters length="10" → рнБСпВЖЧжХ
kana.hiragana length="8"        → ゃまぃすめいおち
arabic.letters length="6"       → فؿآحـآ
```

This is a deliberate Unicode and localization demo: the output is non-Latin on
purpose, to show that the same generator produces whatever script you name.

### Live examples of each script

The same generator, one line per alphabet (`length="10"`), so you can compare the
scripts side by side:

| `alphabet`            | Example output         |

| `roman.upper`         | `DDIXDIIXCX`           |

### All supported names

| `alphabet`            | Contains                                    |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |

| `latin.upper`         | ASCII `A-Z`                                 |
| `latin.letters`       | ASCII `A-Z` and `a-z`                       |

| `digits.fullwidth`    | Full-width digits `０-９`                   |
| `cyrillic.ru.lower`   | Russian `а-я` plus `ё`                      |
| `cyrillic.ru.upper`   | Russian `А-Я` plus `Ё`                      |
| `cyrillic.ru.letters` | Russian Cyrillic, both cases, including `ё` |
| `greek.letters`       | Basic Greek letters                         |
| `hebrew.letters`      | Hebrew `א-ת`                                |
| `arabic.letters`      | Arabic letters `ء-ي`                        |
| `kana.hiragana`       | Japanese hiragana `ぁ-ゖ`                   |
| `kana.katakana`       | Japanese katakana `ァ-ヺ`                   |
| `cjk.unified.basic`   | CJK Unified Ideographs `U+4E00..U+9FFF`     |
| `roman.upper`         | Roman-numeral letters `I V X L C D M`       |
| `roman.lower`         | Roman-numeral letters `i v x l c d m`       |

All 16 names are validated: each one resolves and produces characters from its own
script. Because the set is fixed, use [`include`](#extend-the-set-with-include) /
[`exclude`](#trim-the-set-with-exclude) to adjust it — for example
`alphabet="cyrillic.ru.letters" exclude="ъь"`.

## Unicode scripts by hand

You don't _have_ to use a named alphabet — because `value` accepts any characters,
you can also type a script (or mix several) directly. Named alphabets are still
preferred where one exists: they're documented, validated, and include the awkward
characters a plain range would miss, such as Russian `ё`.

```xml
<gen type="symbol" value="[А-Я]" length="4"/>            <!-- Cyrillic range -->
<gen type="symbol" value="कखगघचछ" length="3"/>          <!-- Devanagari literals -->
<gen type="symbol" value="あア[0-9][A-F]" length="6"/>   <!-- mixed scripts + ranges -->
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
value="[А-Я]" length="4"          → ШФПР
value="कखगघचछ" length="3"         → चचग
value="あア[0-9][A-F]" length="6" → アB4あ7ア
```

## The same alphabets in regex

The alphabet registry is also available inside [`regex`](regex.md) and
[`advanced_regex`](advanced-regex.md) through the escape `\a{name}`, so you can
drop a named script into a larger pattern:

```xml
<gen type="regex" value="\a{kana.hiragana}{5}"/>
<gen type="advanced_regex" value="(?%{70:\a{latin.upper}{2};30:\a{cyrillic.ru.upper}{2}})-[0-9]{4}"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
kana.hiragana{5}          → まぃすめい
weighted upper + -[0-9]4  → KM-8042
```

Plain BMP ranges such as `[а-я]{8}` also work inside `regex`, but the named
alphabets are preferred for the same reasons as above — they're documented,
validated by name, and cover characters that a bare range would drop.
