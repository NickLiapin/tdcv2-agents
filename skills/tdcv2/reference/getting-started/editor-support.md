# Editor support

The npm package ships **two** executables. `tdcv2` generates data; `tdcv2-lsp` is a
language server that gives any LSP-speaking editor live error checking, completion,
hover, go-to-definition, find-references, rename and formatting for `.tdc` files.

It is the same parser and the same validator the CLI uses. A diagnostic you see
underlined in the editor is the one `tdcv2 check` would print — there is no second
implementation to drift.

## What you get

| Feature                | What it does                                                                     |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Live errors**        | Red underlines as you type, at the exact position, with the same `TDC…` codes and "did you mean…" suggestions as [`check`](../reference/cli.md) |
| **Completion**         | Tags, attributes and values — generator types, sequence names for `parent=`, compute tags inside a `<compute>`, and **pack addresses with their `description:` text** |
| **Hover**              | A short description on a tag or an attribute; on `${{Name}}`, which sequence it is and whether it is declared |
| **Go to definition**   | Ctrl/Cmd-click `${{Name}}` or `parent="Name"` and land on `<sequence name="Name">` |
| **Find references**    | Every use of a sequence in the file                                               |
| **Rename**             | Rename a sequence and every reference follows                                      |
| **Format**             | The same pretty-printer as [`tdcv2 format`](../reference/cli.md)                  |

Completion triggers on `<`, a space, `"` and `.` — so typing a dot inside
`value="person."` offers what is actually installed.

Syntax highlighting is a **separate** artefact and needs no server: a TextMate grammar
in the repository's `editor/` folder, which IntelliJ, VS Code and Sublime all read.

## Install

The LSP libraries are **optional peer dependencies**. A plain `npm i tdcv2` for
generating data does not pull them in — they cost nothing until you run the server:

```bash
npm i -g tdcv2
npm i -g vscode-languageserver vscode-languageserver-textdocument
```

Run without them and the server says so rather than throwing a module-resolution stack:

`tdcv2-lsp --stdio`

```
tdcv2-lsp: the TDC language server needs its optional packages, which are not
installed by default. Install them to use the LSP:
  npm i vscode-languageserver vscode-languageserver-textdocument
```

Every editor below points at the same launch line:

```bash
tdcv2-lsp --stdio
```

## Which packs it completes

The server offers the addresses it can actually see: the packs bundled with the install,
plus `data/packs/` or `packs/` under any open workspace folder. Install a locale with
[`tdcv2 pack add`](../data-packs/installing-packs.md) and restart the server to have its
addresses appear in completion, each with the `description:` line from its file header.

## IntelliJ IDEA and other JetBrains IDEs

**Highlighting** — no server needed:

1. Settings → Editor → **TextMate Bundles** → **+** → point it at the repository's
   `editor/` folder.
2. Settings → Editor → File Types → check that `*.tdc` is associated.

**The language server:**

1. Install the free **LSP4IJ** plugin (Red Hat) from the Marketplace.
2. LSP4IJ → New Language Server:
   - Name: `TDC`
   - Command: `tdcv2-lsp --stdio`
   - File name patterns: `*.tdc`, language id `tdc`
3. Open a `.tdc` file — errors are underlined as you type.

## VS Code

A wrapper extension in the repository's `editor/vscode/` folder wires up both pieces and
installs **locally, without the marketplace**:

```bash
cd editor/vscode && npm install && npm run build
```

Then either open that folder in VS Code and press **F5** to try it in a second window, or
run `npx @vscode/vsce package` and install the resulting `.vsix` through
**Install from VSIX…**.

## Neovim

With `nvim-lspconfig`, as a custom server:

```lua
local configs = require('lspconfig.configs')
local lspconfig = require('lspconfig')
if not configs.tdc then
  configs.tdc = {
    default_config = {
      cmd = { 'tdcv2-lsp', '--stdio' },
      filetypes = { 'tdc' },
      root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern('.git', 'data'),
    },
  }
end
lspconfig.tdc.setup({})
```

Highlighting comes from a TextMate-compatible plugin, or from a Tree-sitter grammar if
one is added later.

## Any other editor

Anything that speaks LSP works: point it at `tdcv2-lsp --stdio` for files matching
`*.tdc`. The server holds no editor-specific code — `server.ts` is a thin wrapper over
the protocol, and the parts that do the thinking are pure functions shared with the
library and the CLI.
