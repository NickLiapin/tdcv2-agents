# Installation

TDC targets five ecosystems — **npm** (Node.js / TypeScript), **pip**
(Python), **Maven** (Java), **NuGet** (.NET) and **Cargo** (Rust) — all producing
byte-for-byte identical output from the same config, seed, version and output mode
(see [Determinism & proportions](../core-concepts/determinism.md)).

**All five implementations are complete.** They share one grammar, one set of
diagnostic codes, and a suite of fixtures that hold them to producing the same
bytes — a gigabyte of output from the same config comes out identical in each.
Each one also carries the same command line, so nothing needs another
language's toolchain to run a config.

All five are published: **0.3.3** on npm, PyPI, NuGet and crates.io, and
**0.3.3** on Maven Central — usually the same number, occasionally one
behind, because Central caps how many releases it accepts from a project each month
(see [the Java page](../bindings/java.md)). Equal version numbers are not a
coincidence: where they match, `tdcv2 0.3.3` from any of them answers a
config the same way, down to the byte.

Pick your ecosystem. To try TDC without committing to a language, use the npm
tab: it includes a wrapper script that runs a config without any code of your
own.

#### Node.js — npm

**Requirements:** Node.js **20.0.0** or newer.

```bash
npm install -D tdcv2@0.3.3
npx tdcv2@0.3.3 init
```

That is the whole installation. `init` writes a config and a `tdcv2-examples/`
folder holding three worked examples, and prints the command that runs the first
one. The `common`, `en` and USA data packs come with the package, so they run
without downloading anything.

`npx` is not decoration here: `npm install -D` puts the command in
`node_modules/.bin`, not on your PATH. The other four ecosystems below install it
as a real command, so their examples say plain `tdcv2`.

To work on the engine itself instead, run it from a checkout of the repository.
Build it once:

```bash
npm --workspace typescript run build
```

Then run any config by pointing Node at the built CLI:

```bash
node typescript/dist/cli/main.js tdcv2-examples/01-starter.tdc
```

There's also a one-command wrapper at the repository root, so you don't have to
remember that path:

```bash
./run demo.tdc        # run any file you point it at
```

`./run` is the fastest way to see output: point it at a file and read the
result in the terminal. Under the hood it calls the same CLI. The
full option list — `--seed`, `--count`, `--output`, `--locale`, and the rest —
lives in the [CLI reference](../reference/cli.md).

#### Python — pip

**Requirements:** Python **3.10** or newer.

One command gets you both the library and the `tdcv2` command:

```bash
pip install tdcv2==0.3.3
tdcv2 init
```

That is the whole setup. A starter set of data packs travels inside the wheel,
so the example above runs with nothing else installed.

The DSL and behavior are identical to the npm version: the same `.tdc` config,
run with the same `seed`, produces the same bytes. See
[Language bindings — Python](../bindings/python.md) for the API.

#### Java — Maven

**Requirements:** Java **17** or newer.

The library is one dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.nickliapin</groupId>
  <artifactId>tdcv2</artifactId>
  <version>0.3.3</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle, in `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.nickliapin:tdcv2:0.3.3")
```

A starter set of data packs travels inside the jar, so the example above runs
with nothing else installed.

**The command line is a separate artifact.** Maven
has no equivalent of npm's `bin` — adding a library to a project does not put a
command on your PATH — so the CLI ships as one self-contained jar that needs
nothing but a JDK. It sits under the same coordinates as the library, told apart
by the `cli` classifier:

```bash
curl -LO https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/github/nickliapin/tdcv2/0.3.3/tdcv2-0.3.3-cli.jar
java -jar tdcv2-0.3.3-cli.jar init
```

Worth an alias: `alias tdcv2='java -jar /path/to/tdcv2-cli.jar'`, after which
every command on these pages reads the same as it does everywhere else.

The DSL and behavior are identical to the npm version. See
[Language bindings — Java](../bindings/java.md) for the API.

#### .NET — NuGet

**Requirements:** .NET **6.0** or newer.

The library is one package:

```bash
dotnet add package Tdcv2 --version 0.3.3
```

A starter set of data packs is embedded in the assembly, so it works with
nothing else installed.

**The command line is its own package.** NuGet has no equivalent of npm's `bin`,
so the CLI is a .NET tool package of its own — install it globally and the command
is on your PATH:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global Tdcv2.Cli
tdcv2 init
```

The DSL and behavior are identical to the npm version.

#### Rust — Cargo

**Requirements:** Rust **1.74** or newer.

One crate carries both the library and the command line:

```bash
cargo add tdcv2@0.3.3      # as a dependency
cargo install tdcv2@0.3.3  # as a command
tdcv2 init
```

The starter data packs are compiled into the binary, so an installed crate
works with nothing else on disk.

Or from a checkout:

```bash
cd rust && cargo build --release
./target/release/tdcv2 init
```

The crate takes **no dependencies**, so the build needs nothing but a Rust
toolchain. HTTPS is the one exception: `tdcv2 pack` shells out to `curl`, and
says how to install it if there is none.

The DSL and behavior are identical to the npm version.

## Verify it works

`init` already left you something to run — `tdcv2-examples/01-starter.tdc`, and
two more beside it. **Those files exist only after you run `init`**; nothing
creates them at install time, and they are yours to edit afterwards.

Running the first one is the check that the install works:

```bash
tdcv2 tdcv2-examples/01-starter.tdc
```

The rest of this section builds the same thing by hand, so you can see where
every line comes from. Create a file called `demo.tdc`. It declares two columns and one line of output. The name
is picked from a list with [`type="text"`](../generators/text.md), and the age is drawn
from a range with [`type="number"`](../generators/number.md):

```xml
<tdc>
    <env count="3" seed="demo">
        <sequence name="Name">
            <gen type="text" value="Alice,Bob,Carol,David,Emma"/>
        </sequence>
        <sequence name="Age">
            <gen type="number" value="18..65"/>
        </sequence>
    </env>

    <block>
        <line>
            <data>${{Name}}, age ${{Age}}</data>
        </line>
    </block>
</tdc>
```

Run it with whichever command your install gave you. Three ecosystems put
`tdcv2` on your PATH from the same package that carries the library; Maven and
NuGet have no equivalent of npm's `bin`, so for those the command line is a
second artefact:

| Installed with | The command                                                                                                |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js        | `npx tdcv2@0.3.3 tdcv2-examples/01-starter.tdc`                                                                  |
| Python         | `tdcv2 tdcv2-examples/01-starter.tdc`                                                                      |
| Rust           | `tdcv2 tdcv2-examples/01-starter.tdc`, after `cargo install tdcv2@0.3.3`                                         |
| C#             | `tdcv2 demo.tdc`, after `dotnet tool install --global Tdcv2.Cli`                                           |
| Java           | `java -jar tdcv2-0.3.3-cli.jar tdcv2-examples/01-starter.tdc` — the `cli` classifier of the library's own coordinates            |

From the repository root, `./run demo.tdc` is the shortest of them all.

`tdcv2 demo.tdc`

```
Emma, age 59
David, age 18
Carol, age 53
```

> [!IMPORTANT]

If you get three lines of `Name, age N`, the install works. Run it a second time
to confirm — the three rows come back identical. Then override the row count and
the seed from the command line, without touching the file:

```bash
tdcv2 demo.tdc --count 20 --seed alt
```

## Or skip the config entirely

A config is how you describe a whole dataset. But the same install also answers a single
value, the way a faker does — no file, no `<env>`, one call:

#### TypeScript

```typescript
import { tdc } from 'tdcv2';

tdc.person.lastName(); // Jones
tdc.person.male.firstName(); // Robert
tdc.common.finance.iban(); // DE62299399441396459682
tdc.country.usa.docs.ssn(); // 699209702 — with its real check digits
tdc.lang.ru.person.lastName(); // after `tdcv2 pack add ru`
```

#### Python

```python
from tdcv2 import tdc

tdc.person.lastName()           # Jones
tdc.person.male.firstName()     # Robert
tdc.common.finance.iban()       # DE62299399441396459682
tdc.country.usa.docs.ssn()      # 699209702 — with its real check digits
tdc.lang.ru.person.lastName()   # after `tdcv2 pack add ru`
```

#### Java

```java
import io.github.nickliapin.tdc.quick.Quick;

Quick tdc = Quick.tdc();

tdc.get("person.lastName");        // Jones
tdc.get("person.male.firstName");  // Robert
tdc.get("common.finance.iban");    // DE62299399441396459682
tdc.get("usa.docs.ssn");           // 699209702 — with its real check digits
tdc.get("ru.person.lastName");     // after `java -jar tdcv2-cli.jar pack add ru`
```

#### C#

```csharp
using Tdcv2.Quick;

dynamic tdc = Quick.Tdc;

tdc.person.lastName();          // Jones
tdc.person.male.firstName();    // Robert
tdc.common.finance.iban();      // DE62299399441396459682
tdc.country.usa.docs.ssn();     // 699209702 — with its real check digits
tdc.lang.ru.person.lastName();  // after `tdcv2 pack add ru`
```

#### Rust

```rust
use tdcv2::quick::Quick;

let mut tdc = Quick::new();

tdc.get("person.lastName")?;        // Jones
tdc.get("person.male.firstName")?;  // Robert
tdc.get("common.finance.iban")?;    // DE62299399441396459682
tdc.get("usa.docs.ssn")?;           // 699209702 — with its real check digits
tdc.get("ru.person.lastName")?;     // after `tdcv2 pack add ru`
```

Both routes read the same data packs, so the surname in a one-line call and the surname
in a million-row config come from one list. Which one you want depends on whether the
values have to agree with each other: a config is what ties a city to its country and
holds a share to exactly 30%, and a single call ties nothing to anything.

[Quick API](quick-api.md) — the next page — has the whole surface — `.many(n)`,
`seed()`, `locale()`, and how to reach a specific pack in each language.

> [!NOTE]
> **The values here come from a seed**
>
> Each of the five is random per process on its own, the way a faker is. The values in
> the comments are what the seed `demo` draws, so `tdc.seed('demo')` — `Quick.seeded("demo")`
> in Java and Rust — reproduces them exactly.

## Install data packs (optional)

Names, cities, states, companies, and other value lists ship as **data packs**,
separately from the engine, so updating the library never overwrites your data.
A sensible default set (the top 1000 first names, for instance) is bundled, so
the example above runs without downloading anything. Larger and more specialized
sets are fetched on demand.

Setting this up takes two commands, `init` once and `pack add` for whatever you need.
`pack list` is there to show you the options:

```bash
tdcv2 init            # choose where packs live and the default locale
tdcv2 pack list       # see what the registry offers
tdcv2 pack add en usa # download and wire up the packs you want
```

> [!NOTE]
> On an npm install every one of those is `npx tdcv2@0.3.3 …` — the command lives in
> `node_modules/.bin`. pip, cargo and `dotnet tool install -g` put `tdcv2` on your
> PATH, so there the line above is exactly what you type.

`tdcv2 pack list` prints the catalog and marks what's already installed:

`tdcv2 pack list`

```
Available data packs:

common ✓ installed Common (locale-agnostic) (46.5 KB)
Generators bound to neither a language nor a country: uuid,
hashes, ISBN/ISSN, GTIN/UPC/EAN, card PANs, MRZ, IPv4/IPv6/MAC,
semver, and more.

…

usa ✓ installed Usa (country) (18.8 KB)
Data specific to the USA regardless of the language it is
written in: SSN/ITIN/EIN, ZIP codes, states, street names, ABA
routing numbers, phone format, license plates.
```

Packs **compose** along independent axes — language, country, and a
locale-agnostic `common` — so US data in English is `common` + `en` + `usa`. The
full workflow (the config file, pack shadowing, removing packs) is covered in
[Installing data packs](../data-packs/installing-packs.md).

- **[CLI reference](../reference/cli.md)** — every flag: `--seed`, `--count`, `--output`, `--locale`, `--data-path`, and exit codes.
- **[Installing data packs](../data-packs/installing-packs.md)** — the full `init` / `pack` workflow.
