# Reading files & CSV

When your values already live in a file — a list your team maintains, an export, a
spreadsheet saved as CSV — read them with the [`file`](../generators/file.md)
generator instead of pasting them into the config. This guide walks the common CSV
workflow end to end: a plain list, a single column, the right delimiter, and keeping a
record whole. Every attribute is documented in exhaustive detail on the
[File generator](../generators/file.md) page; this page sticks to the job at hand.

> [!NOTE]
> Example outputs are illustrative — the exact values are random and can differ from one
> core version to the next. What matters is the shape of each step and the counts.

*One CSV read twice, six rows each time.*

- **A** — the source file: four lines, three columns
- **B** — without row=, every field picks its own line, so the record is assembled from pieces that never belonged together (the gray cells)
- **C** — with row=, all three fields read the same line, so every record is a real line of the file

## Set-up: the data folder

Every example below reads from a `data/` folder that sits next to the config and is
passed at run time with `--data-path`. Two files live there — a plain list and a CSV.

`data/cities.txt` (one value per line):

```text
Chicago
Austin
Denver
Boston
Seattle
```

`data/users.csv` (a header row, then records):

```text
first_name,last_name,email,city
John,Smith,john.smith@example.com,Austin
Mary,Johnson,mary.johnson@example.com,Denver
James,Williams,james.williams@example.com,Boston
Emma,Brown,emma.brown@example.com,Seattle
```

Run any config the same way:

```bash
./run example.tdc --data-path ./data
```

## A plain list — one line, one value

**Use it when** you have a flat pool of values (cities, product names, tags) that's
awkward to hard-code into `value="…"`. Point [`src`](../generators/file.md) at the
file and leave [`column`](../generators/file.md) off — each non-empty line becomes
one value:

```xml
<sequence name="City">
  <gen type="file" src="@data/cities.txt"/>
</sequence>
...
<data>${{City}}</data>
```

`./run example.tdc --data-path ./data`

```
Denver
Chicago
Boston
Denver
Austin
```

Lines are chosen uniformly at random, repeats included (`Denver` came up twice). Empty
lines are skipped. For strict file order instead of random picks, add
`order="sequential"` — it emits the lines in exactly the order they appear in (see
[Masks & case](masks-and-case.md)).

## A CSV column — one field from a table

**Use it when** the file is a table and you want a single field — say only the email
addresses. Adding [`column`](../generators/file.md) is what switches the generator
from list mode into CSV mode: the header row is dropped and values come only from
that column.

### By name

Name the column from the header line:

```xml
<gen type="file" src="@data/users.csv" column="email"/>
```

`./run example.tdc --data-path ./data`

```
john.smith@example.com
james.williams@example.com
john.smith@example.com
mary.johnson@example.com
john.smith@example.com
```

The header (`first_name,last_name,email,city`) never appears in the output — TDC
recognizes it as a header and uses it only to find the column.

### By number (1-based)

Address the column by position instead. `column="2"` is the **second** column
(`last_name`) — numbering starts at one, so the first column is `column="1"`, never
`column="0"`. When you address by number, TDC has no header name to match, so add
[`header="true"`](../generators/file.md) to drop the first line:

```xml
<gen type="file" src="@data/users.csv" column="2" header="true"/>
```

`./run example.tdc --data-path ./data`

```
Johnson
Smith
Williams
Smith
Brown
```

The same file with `column="3"` reads the third column, `email` — the same data as
`column="email"`, just addressed by position rather than by name.

### Common mistakes

Off-by-one and delimiter slips fail loudly rather than silently, so they're easy to
spot:

`./run example.tdc --data-path ./data`

```
column="0"  ->  error[TDC062]: file generator: CSV column "0" was not found in the header row
column="9"  ->  error[TDC062]: file generator: CSV column "9" is past the last column — the file has 4
```

- `column="0"` isn't a valid index (numbering starts at 1) — it's read as the literal
  column name `0`, which isn't in the header.
- A number past the last column (`column="9"` on a four-column file) has no cells to
  read.
- If the file's separator isn't a comma, set the delimiter (below) — otherwise the
  whole line lands in a single cell and no column is ever found.

## The delimiter — commas, semicolons, tabs

**Use it when** the export isn't comma-separated. Spreadsheets often save with a
semicolon or a tab. If you leave it unset, TDC splits on commas, finds no cells, and
treats the whole line as one field — so the column is never found. Set
[`delimiter`](../generators/file.md) to match the file. Here are the same users saved
with semicolons, as `data/users_semicolon.csv`:

```text
first_name;last_name;email;city
John;Smith;john.smith@example.com;Austin
Mary;Johnson;mary.johnson@example.com;Denver
James;Williams;james.williams@example.com;Boston
Emma;Brown;emma.brown@example.com;Seattle
```

Without `delimiter`, TDC assumes a comma and can't find the `email` column:

`./run example.tdc --data-path ./data`

```
error[TDC062]: file generator: CSV column "email" was not found in the header row
note: For CSV files, use a header name like column="email" or a 1-based index like column="2".
```

With `delimiter="semicolon"` (or `delimiter=";"`) the cells split correctly:

```xml
<gen type="file" src="@data/users_semicolon.csv" column="email" delimiter="semicolon"/>
```

`./run example.tdc --data-path ./data`

```
john.smith@example.com
james.williams@example.com
john.smith@example.com
mary.johnson@example.com
```

`delimiter` accepts a single character or a name alias — `comma` (the default),
`semicolon`, `pipe`, `tab`. For a tab-separated file (TSV), `delimiter="tab"` and
`delimiter="\t"` are equivalent. The full alias table is on the
[File generator](../generators/file.md) page.

## Keep a record together — the `row` key

**Use it when** several fields have to come from the **same** CSV line. This is the
step people miss most often. Independent [`file`](../generators/file.md) generators
each pick their own line, so the record falls apart — the first name from one line, the
last name from another, the city from a third.

**Without `row`** — three independent generators, so records don't line up (Mary with
Smith's last name, James in the wrong city):

```xml
<sequence name="User">
  <gen name="First" type="file" src="@data/users.csv" column="first_name"/>
  <gen name="Last"  type="file" src="@data/users.csv" column="last_name"/>
  <gen name="City"  type="file" src="@data/users.csv" column="city"/>
</sequence>
...
<data>${{User.First}} ${{User.Last}} — ${{User.City}}</data>
```

`./run example.tdc --data-path ./data`

```
Mary Smith — Denver
John Williams — Austin
Emma Brown — Boston
James Johnson — Seattle
John Brown — Austin
```

**With a shared `row="user"`** — every generator with that key reads the **same** chosen
line, and each column reads its own cell from it. The records hold together:

```xml
<sequence name="User">
  <gen name="First" type="file" src="@data/users.csv" column="first_name" row="user"/>
  <gen name="Last"  type="file" src="@data/users.csv" column="last_name"  row="user"/>
  <gen name="City"  type="file" src="@data/users.csv" column="city"       row="user"/>
</sequence>
```

`./run example.tdc --data-path ./data`

```
Mary Johnson — Denver
James Williams — Boston
John Smith — Austin
John Smith — Austin
Emma Brown — Seattle
```

Now `first_name`, `last_name`, and `city` always come from the same CSV line — the
fields can't drift apart. The key can be any non-empty string (`row="user"`), and
generators link up when they share the same `row`, `src`, `delimiter`, and header mode.
This works on **any** engine (the default is streaming, so memory doesn't grow with the
number of rows).

### Weighted rows — draw a line by frequency

**Use it when** the linked line should be picked by a real frequency rather than
uniformly — an item at its actual sales rate, with its own price and category coming
along for the ride. Add [`weight="column"`](../generators/file.md) to one field of the
group and the line is drawn by a weighted quota from that column (exact, like a
[`percent`](../generators/text.md) split), while the other fields still read from the
same chosen line. Say `data/catalog.csv` looks like this:

```text
name,category,price,sales
Pen,Office,1.10,500
Coffee,Drinks,4.50,1200
Backpack,Bags,45.00,80
```

```xml
<sequence name="Item">
  <gen name="Name"  type="file" src="@data/catalog.csv" column="name"     row="i" weight="sales"/>
  <gen name="Price" type="file" src="@data/catalog.csv" column="price"    row="i"/>
  <gen name="Cat"   type="file" src="@data/catalog.csv" column="category" row="i"/>
</sequence>
...
<data>${{Item.Name}} | ${{Item.Cat}} | ${{Item.Price}}</data>
```

`./run example.tdc --data-path ./data`

```
Coffee | Drinks | 4.50
Pen | Office | 1.10
Coffee | Drinks | 4.50
```

Coffee (sales 1200) comes up most often and Backpack (sales 80) rarely — and each
item's price and category always match its own row.

**Engine note.** Without `weight`, a linked group runs on any engine. **With
`weight`**, the config always runs on the in-memory engine: a streaming engine can't
weight the line choice without knowing the file's totals first. If you force
`--engine 2`, TDC tells you so plainly instead of silently emitting incoherent columns.
See [Coherent & relational data](coherent-data.md) for the full picture.

### Limitations (v1)

- `row` works only inside a [`<sequence>`](../core-concepts/sequences.md). The output
  block has no generators, so the question never comes up there.
- `row` requires [`column`](../generators/file.md) — it's a CSV feature, not something
  a plain text list can use.
- The same `row` key across **different sources** links them PROPORTIONALLY, not by line
  number. The key is one draw per row, and each file scales it to its own length — so an
  8-line file at its line 8 pairs with a 4-line file at its line 4, and its line 2 pairs
  with line 1. Two files of the same length line up exactly; two of different lengths stay
  in step but not in lockstep. If you need line-for-line, put the columns in one file.

## A file of measurements — `read="quantile"`

Everything above treats a file as a **bag of values**: pick one, put it in the cell.
That is right for something countable — a city, a status, a number of orders — and
`weight=` even honours the real shares.

It is wrong for a **measurement**. A thousand recorded transaction amounts, read as a
bag, give a thousand distinct amounts however many rows you ask for: a million rows
still hold those thousand values with nothing between them. Real money is not shaped
like that, and a model trained on it learns a structure the data never had.

`read="quantile"` reads the same file the other way — sorted once, and treated as a
ruler that a row can land anywhere on:

```xml
<sequence name="Amount"><gen type="file" src="amounts.txt" read="quantile"/></sequence>
```

The shape of the sample comes back, the values between the observations appear on their
own, and the answer is written with as many decimal places as the file used. Add
`sample="exact"` to sweep the distribution instead of drawing from it, and the run
reproduces the sample with no sampling noise at all. Both are covered in full on the
[File generator](../generators/file.md#readquantile--a-measured-sample-as-a-distribution)
page.

## Writing CSV back out

Reading CSV is half the job — **writing** it safely is the other half. A value with a
comma or a quote in it would break the row. The [`csv`](masks-and-case.md) filter wraps
a field the way RFC 4180 requires:

```xml
<data>${{Id}},${{Name | csv}},${{Category}}</data>
```

`./run example.tdc`

```
7,"Knife set, 3 pcs",Kitchen
2,"Coffee ""Arabica"" 250g",Grocery
```

The comma inside `Knife set, 3 pcs` no longer splits the row, and the inner quotes in
`Coffee "Arabica" 250g` are doubled. The [`csv`](masks-and-case.md) and
[`sql`](masks-and-case.md) escaping filters, and building whole CSV/JSON/SQL files,
are covered in [Masks & case](masks-and-case.md) and
[Output formats](output-formats.md).

## Where files are found

`src="@data/…"` is looked up in the folders passed with `--data-path`; a bare
`src="names.txt"` is looked up next to the config; absolute paths work too. Files
are read as UTF-8, and a path that doesn't resolve stops
rendering with an error instead of silently producing nothing. The full resolution
table is on the [File generator](../generators/file.md) page.
