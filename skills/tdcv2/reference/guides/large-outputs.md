# Large outputs & streaming

**By default, TDC generates straight to disk.** Memory does **not** grow with the row
count: each row is computed on the fly from its number rather than stored in an array, so
the practical limit is disk space and time, not RAM. This needs no setup — it is how an
ordinary run already behaves. A handful of config shapes are the exception and are
listed in [Which engine runs your config](#which-engine-runs-your-config).

Example outputs on this page are illustrative and can differ by core version. Where the
page makes a numeric claim ("exactly 70/30", "128 MB flat"), watch the shape of the
result, not the exact bytes.

*Memory against rows produced. Schematic, not measured — the point is the shape of each curve, not its height.*

- **A** — holding every row in memory: the cost grows with the run
- **B** — streaming: one window at a time, so the cost stays flat however long the run is

## Two disk engines, chosen for you

Two engines run under "disk", and TDC picks between them **from your config**:

- **The fast streaming engine** — used for almost everything. Lazy, multi-threaded (see
  [`--jobs`](../reference/cli.md)), memory O(number of fields). Exact percentages,
  [`parent`](hierarchical-dependencies.md) dependencies, [`<mix>`](../reference/tags.md),
  [`<distinct>`](../constructs/unique-values.md) — all on the fly.
- **The exact on-disk engine** — for a promise about the **finished** column rather than
  the current row: an env-level [`<uniq>`](../constructs/unique-values.md) group,
  [`uniq="true"`](../constructs/unique-values.md) on a compound sequence or on a counter,
  a [`parent`](hierarchical-dependencies.md) whose parent is not a text sequence, and a
  weighted [`advanced_regex`](../generators/advanced-regex.md) — `(?%{…})`.
  It guarantees the result exactly, and it pays for that by checking every tuple and
  repairing the few that repeat. Memory stays bounded while the repeats stay under the
  repair's cap; past that the run hands itself to the in-memory engine and the memory
  follows `count`. See the table below — the cap is the number to reason about, not the
  row count.

  Uniqueness is a promise about the **finished dataset**, not about any one row, so it
  cannot be settled a row at a time. A worker sees only its own range of rows and could not
  tell a duplicate outside that range from a value it has never seen — so nobody asks it to.
  The arrangement is worked out ONCE, before any worker starts, and handed down; the workers
  only lay out the rows they were given. An env-level `<uniq>` group therefore splits across
  `--jobs` like anything else, in all five implementations.

  `uniq="true"` on a sequence does not, and cannot: it rearranges the generators inside one
  compound column, which a worker resolving a row on its own has no way to reproduce. That
  one stays on a single thread and says so.

Disk mode has a third destination, and it is the one worth knowing about: seven config
shapes send the run back to the small in-memory engine, where memory grows with `count`.
One of them is the commonest way of writing `uniq`. [Which engine runs your
config](#which-engine-runs-your-config) lists all seven.

The choice is **deterministic — based on the config, not the hardware** — so the same
config gives the same result on every machine (reproducibility across machines is a core
TDC guarantee).

## Which engine runs your config

`mode="disk"` asks for bounded memory. It does not always get it. TDC reads the config
first, and seven shapes route the run to the **small in-memory engine**, whose memory grows
with the row count. They are checked in this order.

| Shape                                                                                                                                                                | Why it cannot stream                                                                                                                           |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A [`template`](../generators/template.md) `value` that interpolates a field — `common.vehicle.model.${{Brand}}`                                                     | The address is not known until the sibling column has a value, so it has to be resolved per row against the other sequences.                   |
| [`weight=`](../generators/file.md) and [`row=`](../generators/file.md) on the same `file` generator                                                                | Weighting a linked row draw to an exact quota needs the file's totals up front. **`weight=` on its own streams** — it is the pair that cannot.                                                                |
| `uniq="true"` on a single drawn column, alone or beside literal text                                                                                                 | The draw is **without replacement**, so the pool and the set already taken both span the whole column.                                         |
| [`type="http"`](../generators/http.md) — a network call                                                                                                             | It is neither reproducible nor synchronous, and resolves in an async pass after the rest of the registry is built.                             |
| A `percent=` inside a [`<switch>`](../constructs/switch.md#a-share-inside-a-branch) branch keyed on several values — `is="US\|CA\|MX"` — or inside `<default>`      | The share is a quota over the branch's own rows, and those rows are a union of subsets, or what every other branch left behind. Neither can be numbered one row at a time. |
| A column **derived from another column** — a [running total](../generators/running.md), a [statistic](../generators/stat.md), a [date measured from another column](../generators/date.md), a formula | Each reads a column that has to exist first, which the streaming builder refuses by name. |
| A bare [`parent="Name"`](../guides/hierarchical-dependencies.md) with no value                                                                                       | It narrows a column to the rows where the parent produced anything, and that is not knowable without the parent's whole column. |

One more shape reaches the same engine without being on this list: a pack body carrying
its own `<valid>`. Rejecting a drawn row and drawing again is a decision about the whole
column with no row-at-a-time form, so the streaming builder refuses it by name — and a
refusal routes here the way every other refusal does.

Whatever is left that asks about the finished column goes to the exact on-disk engine, and
everything else streams.

So `uniq` lands on two different engines depending on how it is written:

| `uniq` written as                                                        | Engine        | Memory                                |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------ |
| `uniq="true"` on one drawn column — `text`, `number`, `date`, `template` | in-memory     | grows with `count`                    |
| `uniq="true"` on a column composed of a drawn part and `<data>` literals | in-memory     | grows with `count`                    |
| `uniq="true"` on a [counter](../generators/counters.md)                 | exact on-disk | grows with `count`                    |
| `uniq="true"` on a compound sequence (named `<gen>` fields)              | exact on-disk | **bounded** while repeats stay in hand |
| An env-level [`<uniq>`](../constructs/unique-values.md) group           | exact on-disk | **bounded** while repeats stay in hand |

The last two are bounded, and the bound was proved by FORBIDDING the memory rather than
watching it: each run below was given a hard heap ceiling and had to finish inside it.

```
env-level <uniq> group   4,800,000 rows   finished with the heap capped at 256 MB
compound uniq            4,800,000 rows   finished with the heap capped at 256 MB
env-level <uniq> group  10,000,000 rows   finished with the heap capped at 512 MB
```

Watching instead of forbidding is what made this table wrong before. Left uncapped, the
4,800,000-row group peaks around 850 MB — but it completes in 256 MB when it is not allowed
more, because a garbage-collected runtime takes the room it is given. Peak resident measures
what the runtime CHOSE; the ceiling measures what the run NEEDS.

**What breaks the bound is repeats, not rows.** The repair works on the rows whose tuples
collide, and it holds them; past `max(20,000, count / 1000)` of them it stops and hands the
run to the in-memory engine, where memory follows `count` again. Same 4,800,000 rows, two
value spaces:

```
20,000 x 20,000 values → failed even with the heap capped at 512 MB
40,000 x 40,000 values → finished inside 256 MB
```

So the number to reason about is how many tuples your values can make against how many rows
you asked for — not the row count on its own. Widen a column and the same run fits. How many
repeats a given config actually produces follows the birthday formula closely — a
6,000,000-row run over 900,000,000 possible pairs handed the verifier 19,851 candidate
groups where the formula predicts about 20,000 — but what that costs does not. Run it and
watch `--progress`.

The two in-memory rows are the ones that genuinely follow `count`, and
[`TDC299`](../reference/errors.md) warns about them from 100,000 rows up. A `uniq` counter
does too: 2,000,000 rows needed 512 MB and 4,000,000 needed 1 GB, measured the same way.

**No form of `uniq` runs on the fast streaming engine.** It refuses `uniq` by name, so a
config that asked for streaming is told rather than handed data that quietly repeats:

`./run uniq.tdc --engine 2`

```
tdcv2: stream mode: uniq (a whole-column rearrangement) ("K") is not supported yet — use mode="disk" instead (the router then picks an engine that can), or remove it.
```

You normally never see a message like that. The router picks the engine itself, and a
refusal only surfaces when a config _names_ a streaming engine and so has asked to be told.

A downgrade is not a bug. Each of the seven shapes is a promise about a whole column, and an
engine that answered it from one row would emit data that looks right and is not. What it
costs is memory: on the in-memory engine the whole column is held, so a run using one of
these shapes is bounded by RAM rather than by disk. [`preflight()`](#preflight--a-memory-risk-estimate)
estimates that before the run.

The list above is decided **before** the run, which matters for `--jobs`: a parallel run
hands each worker a forced streaming engine, and a worker has nowhere to fall back to. A
last-resort net is still there for a rare `uniq`/`distinct`/`parent` edge case the list
cannot see — an automatically routed disk run that the streaming engine refuses anyway
falls back to the in-memory engine rather than failing. A **forced** `--engine 2` still
fails, which is the point of forcing it:

`./run report.tdc --engine 2`

```
tdcv2: a statistic ("Avg") is computed over every row of the run, including the ones after this one, so it cannot be computed one row at a time; the in-memory engine handles it (run without a forced streaming engine)
```

A forced `--engine 3` is the exception, and worth knowing before you measure anything:
it refuses only a `uniq` too tight for its bounded repair, and on every other shape in the
list above it falls back to the in-memory engine and prints its bytes — exit 0, no message.
Deliberately so, because those shapes are the ones the lazy path cannot express at all and
covering them is what engine 3 is for. It does mean a memory reading taken with
`--engine 3` on one of them is a reading of engine 1.

### What streams that you might expect not to

Two constructs read the columns beside them and still stream, because each needs only
its OWN row — and one row is exactly what the lazy registry can produce:

| Construct                                                                             | Streams? | Why                                                                              |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`<gen type="formula">`](../generators/formula.md)                                   | **yes**  | Row i is computed from row i. Nothing before it takes part.                      |
| A [distribution parameter](statistical-distributions.md#a-parameter-can-follow-another-column) written as an expression | **yes**  | It changes the value the draws become, never how many draws a row spends.        |
| [`read="quantile"`](../generators/file.md) on a file                                 | **yes**  | The file is sorted once; a row then takes one point on it.                       |
| [`<gen type="running">`](../generators/running.md)                                   | no       | Row 900,000,000 IS the sum of everything before it.                              |
| [`<gen type="stat">`](../generators/stat.md)                                         | no       | The rows AFTER this one are part of the answer.                                  |

The dividing line is not "drawn or computed" — it is whether the answer needs a row
other than this one.

## A billion rows

```xml
<env count="1000000000" seed="s">
  <sequence name="Gender"><gen type="text" value="M,F" percent="70,30"/></sequence>
  <sequence name="Id"><gen type="increment" value="1"/></sequence>
</env>
```

Here are the first eight rows of that run:

`./run big.tdc   (first 8 rows of the billion)`

```
M,1
F,2
M,3
M,4
M,5
F,6
M,7
M,8
```

> [!WARNING]

TDC uses the fast streaming engine here (no heavy uniq). It does **not** materialize a
registry — each row's value is computed from its number, so memory is **O(fields)**, not
O(rows), and the percentages stay **exact** (precisely 70/30, with no array held
anywhere). The result is deterministic.

**The fast engine handles almost everything:** simple and compound
[`<sequence>`](../core-concepts/sequences.md), independent generators
([`text`](../generators/text.md), [`number`](../generators/number.md),
[`date`](../generators/date.md), [`regex`](../generators/regex.md),
[`symbol`](../generators/symbol.md), [`template`](../generators/template.md)), exact
[`percent`](../reference/attributes.md), [counters](../generators/counters.md), the
[built-ins](../reference/builtins.md) (`_count`/`_first`/`_last`/`_total`),
[`parent`](hierarchical-dependencies.md) dependencies (any depth),
[`<distinct>`](../constructs/unique-values.md), and [`<mix>`](../reference/tags.md) — all on the fly,
exact, and in parallel. What it does not do is any form of
[`uniq`](../constructs/unique-values.md). Uniqueness is a promise about the finished
column and this engine only ever sees one row, so every `uniq` goes elsewhere — to the
exact on-disk engine or to the in-memory one, depending on how it is written. [Which
engine runs your config](#which-engine-runs-your-config) says which.

(In the fast engine `parent` works only when the parent is a sequence with a finite list
of values — a [`text`](../generators/text.md) sequence. Inheriting from a numeric range
sends the config to the exact engine instead.)

### Parent dependencies in the stream

A child sequence with [`parent="Parent.Value"`](hierarchical-dependencies.md) is active
on exactly the rows where the parent produced that value, and its percentages are **exact
within the subset**. Nesting goes any depth (parent → child → grandchild).

```xml
<env count="1000" seed="s">
  <sequence name="Gender"><gen type="text" value="M,F" percent="70,30"/></sequence>
  <sequence name="Male" parent="Gender.M"><gen type="text" value="James,William,Robert" percent="50,30,20"/></sequence>
  <sequence name="Female" parent="Gender.F"><gen type="text" value="Mary,Emma" percent="60,40"/></sequence>
</env>
```

On `M` rows the `Male` field is filled; on `F` rows the `Female` field is. First 6 of
1000 rows:

`./run parent.tdc   (first 6 of 1000)`

```
F,,Emma
M,James,
F,,Mary
F,,Mary
M,Robert,
M,James,
```

The distribution is exact at every level — no arrays, each row computed from its number:

`./run parent.tdc   (counts over 1000 rows)`

```
Gender  M         700
Gender  F         300
Male    James     350
Male    William   210
Male    Robert    140
Female  Mary      180
Female  Emma      120
```

Exactly 700 `M` and 300 `F`; inside the 700 males exactly 350/210/140 (50/30/20 of 700),
inside the 300 females exactly 180/120 (60/40 of 300). On "foreign" rows the child field
is blank — `Male` is empty on female rows, `Female` on male rows.

### Uniqueness across the whole dataset (`uniq`)

[`uniq="true"`](../constructs/unique-values.md) on a compound sequence makes the **tuple of all its
fields unique across the whole dataset**. That is a promise about the finished column, so
it runs on the exact on-disk engine rather than the streaming one. Each column is laid out
to its exact quota and the tuples are then checked against each other; when one column on
its own already gives every row a different value, the check is skipped.

```xml
<env count="6" seed="s">
  <sequence name="Combo" uniq="true">
    <gen name="Letter" type="text" value="A,B,C"/>
    <gen name="Digit" type="text" value="1,2"/>
  </sequence>
</env>
```

All 6 rows are different — that's the full `3 × 2` space:

`./run uniq.tdc   (all 6 rows)`

```
C,2
A,1
B,2
A,2
C,1
B,1
```

The same holds for env-level [`<uniq>`](../constructs/unique-values.md), where the unique tuple is
built from **separate** sequences rather than from the fields of one:

```xml
<env count="6" seed="s">
  <uniq>
    <sequence name="A"><gen type="text" value="x,y,z"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="B"><gen type="text" value="m,n"/></sequence>
  </uniq>
</env>
```

`./run env-uniq.tdc   (all 6 combinations of 3 x 2)`

```
z,n
x,n
x,m
y,n
y,m
z,m
```

Memory stays bounded in both shapes: the columns are resolved from the row number, and the
duplicate check runs externally rather than holding the dataset. Time is the cost, not
RAM — see the warning above.

**Capacity is checked before the run starts.** If you ask for more unique rows than the
data can produce, TDC fails immediately with a clear error — not eight hours later,
halfway through the file:

`./run oversized-uniq.tdc`

```
tdcv2: uniq: group "K1 × K2" cannot produce 10000000 unique combinations — the values drawn for these sequences allow at most 100 distinct rows. Add more values to a member (more distinct names, wider ranges…) or lower the count.
```

### `<mix>` in the stream

[`<mix>`](../reference/tags.md) picks a case for each row by **exact percent** (the same
math as `percent`), then assembles the case body: text, generators, and **nested
`<mix>`** to any depth. A generator or nested `<mix>` inside a case runs **on that case's
subset** of rows — its counter counts within the case, and nested percentages are exact
within the subset.

```xml
<env count="1000" seed="s">
  <mix name="Status" percent="20,50,30">
    <case><data>new</data></case>
    <case><data>active-</data><gen type="number" value="1..3"/></case>
    <case><data>closed</data></case>
  </mix>
</env>
```

First 6 of 1000 rows:

`./run mix.tdc   (first 6 of 1000)`

```
active-1
new
active-3
closed
active-1
closed
```

Over 1000 rows the split is exact: 200 `new`, 500 `active-N`, 300 `closed`. `<mix>` also
composes with [`parent`](hierarchical-dependencies.md), in which case it's active only
on the parent's rows.

## Why `percent` + `uniq` is the expensive pair

Exact percentages are laid out over the whole column; uniqueness is checked over the whole
column. Each is affordable on its own. Asking for both at once is a constrained layout
problem stacked on top of the check, and that is either full materialization or an
NP-hard search. The exact on-disk engine does it anyway, at any size, by holding the
layout and repairing the collisions it finds — correctly, and much more slowly than either
constraint alone.

## Parallelism — automatic

Generation is **CPU-bound**, not disk-bound (writing is far faster than computing rows),
and rows in the streaming engine are independent (each one comes from its own number), so
TDC computes them on several cores — which the architecture allows without any extra work on your part.

**You set nothing.** If the config is splittable (fast engine, no in-line built-in
generators) and the file is big enough, TDC uses `cores − 1` (7 on an 8-core box);
otherwise it quietly runs on one core:

```bash
npx tdcv2 customers.tdc -o customers.csv
```

The result is **byte-identical regardless of core count** (same seed): each core computes
a contiguous range of rows into a temp file, and the temp files are then concatenated
strictly in order. Thread count is only about speed — it never affects the data.

The automatic count is also cut to fit memory, and this is the usual answer to "why is
this not faster?". Each worker is charged 120 MB plus **50×** the on-disk size of every
`src=` file it will parse, and the total may not exceed half of physical RAM — so a
config reading a large CSV gets far fewer workers than there are cores. The reduction is
announced only when `--jobs` was passed explicitly; an automatic run makes it in
silence.

A benchmark — 1,000,000 rows, six fields (a counter, two template names, a `percent`
column, a normal distribution, a date), a 74 MB file, on a 12-core machine:

| `--jobs` |   time |  speedup |
| :------- | -----: | -------: |
| 1        | 6.93 s |       ×1 |
| 2        | 4.04 s |     ×1.7 |
| 4        | 2.27 s |     ×3.1 |
| 8        | 1.57 s | **×4.4** |
| 12       | 1.72 s |     ×4.0 |
| auto     | 1.69 s |     ×4.1 |

Two lessons. **More threads isn't always faster:** twelve threads on twelve cores lose to
eight — they fight over the same cores and the same disk. And **the numbers above belong to
that machine**, not to TDC.

Where that matters most is a machine whose cores are not all the same. Auto takes
`cores − 1`, and on an Apple M2 Max — 12 cores, but 8 performance and 4 efficiency — that
reaches into the slow four. The same six-field config, measured here:

| `--jobs` |   time |
| :------- | -----: |
| 1        | 8.82 s |
| 2        | 6.57 s |
| 4        | **5.00 s** |
| 8        | 5.63 s |
| 12       | 6.40 s |
| auto     | 6.07 s |

Auto is 21% off the best, and the peak win is ×1.8 rather than ×4.4. On a CPU-heavy column
it can go further wrong: a `formula` doing `sin`, `log` and `gauss` over 1,000,000 rows took
3.05 s on one thread and 4.71 s on auto — slower in wall time and six times the CPU.

So: leave it alone on a machine with uniform cores, and if a run matters, time it at a few
values of `--jobs` on the machine that will do it. What never changes is the data — every
one of those runs produced the same bytes.

The speedup depends on how expensive a row is. On a truly cheap config (two fields, a
counter and `M,F`) the win is only ~×1.6 — spinning up threads costs time, and on light
work that overhead eats most of the gain. A speedup figure quoted without its config is
meaningless.

Set it by hand with [`--jobs N`](../reference/cli.md) if you want (`--jobs 1` forces
single-threaded); the output is identical either way:

```bash
npx tdcv2 customers.tdc --jobs 8 -o customers.csv
```

Sometimes parallelism does **not** kick in, and the rule is narrower than it looks. Both
row-at-a-time engines split a run across cores — the fast streaming one and the exact
on-disk one — so a config that only fell back from engine 2 to engine 3 still uses every
core. What cannot be split is a run on the **in-memory** engine, and one shape in
particular: `uniq="true"` on a sequence, which rearranges the generators inside a compound
column, and a worker resolving a row on its own cannot reproduce that.

An `<uniq>` GROUP at the `<env>` level is not that shape and does parallelise. Measured on
1,500,000 rows: `--jobs 1` spent 17.4 s of CPU, `--jobs 8` spent 52.0 s across eight
workers, and the two files are byte-identical, exactly as `--jobs` promises.

Auto stays quiet when it cannot split, but if you asked for `--jobs` explicitly, TDC tells
you why. The output is correct either way.

**Nor does it below 100,000 rows.** Under that, spawning the threads and joining the
pieces costs more than the split saves, so auto stays on one. The number is worth knowing
for one reason: it is the only thing that changes between a run of 99,999 rows and one of
100,000, so if those two ever differ in anything but length, the split is where to look.

## The engine is chosen from your config, not your hardware

Which of the three engines runs is decided by TDC **from the config's contents**, never
from the machine. This matters: if the choice depended on "how much RAM is free right
now", then **the same config with the same seed could produce different data on different
computers** — and cross-machine reproducibility is TDC's central guarantee. Because
routing depends only on the config, a given config always takes the same engine and gives
the same result everywhere.

The memory estimate (`preflight()`, below) is only **advice**; it switches nothing and
changes no output. To force a specific engine use
[`--engine 1|2|3`](../reference/cli.md) (advanced); `mode="memory"` is the small in-RAM
engine for small datasets.

The same override exists **inside the config**, as `engine` on `<env>` — the flag
without the command line:

```xml
<env count="1000" seed="s" engine="1">
```

`1` is in-memory, `2` streaming, `3` exact-on-disk; anything else is an error. Prefer
`mode="memory"` / `mode="disk"`, which say what you want rather than which
implementation delivers it — engine numbers are an escape hatch for reproducing a
specific behavior, and a config pinned to an engine won't benefit from better routing
later. When both are present, `engine` wins over `mode`; a `--engine` or `--mode` on the
command line overrides either.

## Terminal methods (the library)

Every method here goes through whichever engine [the router
picks](#which-engine-runs-your-config) — the object ones included. None of them forces the
in-memory engine, so none of them materialises a registry: memory is O(fields) unless the
method's own return value is the thing that grows.

| Method         | Text output             | Memory                    | Use for                          |
| :------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------- |
| `toString()`   | collected whole         | O(fields) + the full text | small / medium results           |
| `toIterator()` | one row at a time       | O(fields)                 | large text results, row by row   |
| `toStream()`   | Node `Readable`         | O(fields)                 | pipe to a file / HTTP / archiver |
| `writeFile()`  | chunks to a file        | O(fields)                 | simplest way to write a big file |
| CLI            | chunks                  | O(fields)                 | the command line                 |
| `toArray()`    | object rows, whole      | O(rows) — it returns them | small / medium object fixtures   |
| `iterate()`    | object rows, one-by-one | O(fields)                 | object output, one row at a time |
| `getAt(index)` | one object row          | O(fields)                 | point access, not bulk           |

`toArray()` is the only object method whose memory grows with `count`, and it grows because
the array it hands back IS every row. `iterate()` and `getAt()` build nothing of the sort.
Measured on a 50,000,000-row config: `getAt(49_999_999)` answered in 4 ms and the first
three rows of `iterate()` arrived in 2 ms, both on a flat heap.

For big files, use the CLI, `writeFile()`, `toIterator()`, `toStream()` — or `iterate()`
if you want objects rather than text:

```ts
const tdc = new TDC({ configFile: "./customers.tdc" });
tdc.writeFile("./customers.csv");
```

Or through a stream:

```ts
import { createWriteStream } from "node:fs";

tdc.toStream().pipe(createWriteStream("./customers.csv"));
```

### Proof: half a million rows, memory stays flat

Claims about "O(fields)" are worth more with real numbers behind them. Take a
500,000-row config and run the terminal methods.

**`writeFile()` — a file on disk.** It writes chunks as it generates:

`node writeFile.js   (500,000 rows)`

```
bytes: 4388895        // ~4.4 MB, 500,000 rows
M,1
M,2
M,3
```

**`toIterator()` — walk every row, memory doesn't move.** Sampling process RSS at
checkpoints as the row count grows:

`node measure.js`

```
rows=100000  RSS=128 MB
rows=200000  RSS=128 MB
rows=300000  RSS=128 MB
rows=400000  RSS=128 MB
rows=500000  RSS=128 MB
```

The line is **flat** — 128 MB at 100,000 rows and the same 128 MB at 500,000. Watch the
flatness, not the absolute number: RSS depends on the machine and the Node version, and
this was an Apple M2 Max on Node 20.

**`toStream()` equals `writeFile()` byte-for-byte.** Both take the same streaming path:

```ts
new TDC({ configFile: "./customers.tdc" })
  .toStream()
  .pipe(createWriteStream("out2.csv"));
// md5(out2.csv) === md5(out.csv)  →  true
```

## `preflight()` — a memory-risk estimate

`preflight()` estimates memory risk before generating, comparing the estimate to the
machine's **total** RAM (not "free right now" — the OS hands memory to a process on
demand, so a snapshot of what's free at this instant is misleading).

```ts
const diagnostic = tdc.preflight();
```

On a normal (disk) run even half a million rows is no risk at all — `preflight()` returns
`undefined`. It only warns for an explicit `mode="memory"` on a large `count`, where the
data really is materialized:

```ts
// disk (default), 500,000 rows:
new TDC({ configFile: "./customers.tdc" }).preflight();
//  →  undefined

// mode="memory", 50,000,000 rows — returns a Diagnostic:
const d = new TDC({
  configFile: "./customers.tdc",
  mode: "memory",
  count: 50_000_000,
}).preflight();
```

`node preflight.js`

```
d.severity  warning
d.code      TDC200
d.message   estimated memory need (~20.5 GB) is a large share of this
            machine's RAM (32.0 GB) — may lean on swap and slow down
d.hint      This will still run; for very large datasets mode="disk"
            keeps memory flat regardless of count.
```

So on an ordinary disk run preflight practically never fires: the streaming engine holds
O(fields), not O(rows), so a billion rows go through without a complaint — that's what
it's built for. The estimate is only **advice**; it doesn't switch engines or change
output.

If you know you'll consume streaming output through `toString()`, name the scenario
explicitly:

```ts
const diagnostic = tdc.preflight({ output: "streaming" });
```

## What gets materialized in RAM

Both disk engines keep nothing extra in memory. Materialization happens in the **small
in-RAM engine** — reached by the object API (`toArray`/`iterate`/`getAt`), by an explicit
`mode="memory"`, and by any of the [six config shapes that route a disk run back to
it](#which-engine-runs-your-config). There it holds, up front:

- the built-ins `_count`, `_first`, `_last`, `_total`;
- each simple `<sequence>`;
- each field of a compound sequence;
- parent-filtered arrays of values or `undefined`;
- CSV row-link plans for linked external data.

A rough estimate: `count × number_of_sequence_slots`. For example, this compound sequence:

```xml
<sequence name="Person">
  <gen name="FirstName" type="template" value="person.female.firstName"/>
  <gen name="LastName" type="template" value="person.lastName"/>
</sequence>
```

`./run person.tdc   (${{Person.FirstName}} ${{Person.LastName}})`

```
Emma Johnson
Olivia Smith
Sophia Brown
Ava Davis
Mia Wilson
```

takes two sequence slots: `Person.FirstName` and `Person.LastName`.

## Practical rules

- For a file of any size, just use `writeFile()` or the CLI — it's disk by default, and
  memory doesn't grow with rows.
- Before a very large run, check the config against [the six shapes that route it back
  into memory](#which-engine-runs-your-config). Simple `uniq="true"` is the one to watch.
- To speed up a big run, add [`--jobs N`](../reference/cli.md) (on the fast engine).
- `toString()` suits tests and small results, but collects all text into one
  string — not for big files.
- `toArray()` returns every row as an object, so its memory is the array itself — that one
  is for small sets. `iterate()` and `getAt()` are not: they run on the same engine as text
  output and hold nothing, so `iterate()` is a fine way to stream objects.
