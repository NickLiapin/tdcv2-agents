# Masks & case

A generator produces **raw** values — exactly as they're built. A US Social Security
number is nine digits in a row, a date is `2020-05-14`, a name comes out exactly as it
sits in the list. A generator is about **what** the data is, not **how it looks**:
separators, case, and word order aren't its job.

Here's what a plain [`text`](../generators/text.md) generator emits for a batch of
SSNs (`order="sequential"` so the values below stay stable and repeat in order):

```xml
<gen type="text" value="378984323,889735724,852139753,263243158" order="sequential"/>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
378984323
889735724
852139753
263243158
```

The values are **valid**, but reading them like this is painful. Formatting reshapes an
already-generated value on its way out, and it always has three parts:

**raw value → processor → finished look** — for example, `378984323` → mask
`xxx-xx-xxxx` → `378-98-4323`.

There are two independent processors:

- **mask** — cuts the string into pieces and puts separators between them (`x`, `w`, `*`);
- **case** — `upper`, `lower`, `capitalize`, `title`.

On top of those come the operations `slice`, `replace`, `trim`, `group`, and `compact`
(all below), the escaping filters `csv` / `sql`, and `order="sequential"` for taking
values **in order** instead of at random.

*One real value going through one real mask.*

- **A** — the generated value, before the mask
- **B** — the mask: an x is a slot, and anything else is a literal kept as-is
- **C** — the result — the curves show which source character filled which slot

## Three routes, one behavior

The same formatting is available three ways — same result, pick what's convenient:

| Route                                                 | How you write it             | Best when                                  |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| A filter in interpolation                             | `${{X \| mask:…}}`           | one value in one spot in the text          |
| An attribute on [`<gen>`](../generators/overview.md) | `<gen … mask="…" case="…"/>` | formatting the **whole** generator         |
| A tag in [`<compute>`](../compute/overview.md)       | `<mask pattern="…">…</mask>` | when formatting is a step in a calculation |

Most examples below use the filter route, which lives in
[interpolation](../core-concepts/output-formatting.md#filters). Each compute tag is
documented in [Strings & formatting](../compute/strings.md).

## Mask — cut and space out

**Problem.** A number arrives as one glued-together string (`378984323`) — you can't
see where the groups start and end.

**Tool.** A mask runs its pattern left to right. Each **slot** eats a piece of the
input; everything else prints as a literal:

| Slot           | Takes from the input                                                         |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x`            | one character                                                                |
| `w`            | one word (letters up to a space) and **swallows one** space                  |
| `*`            | everything not yet consumed                                                  |
| `x[0]` `w[-1]` | a **named** position — see [Moving pieces](#moving-pieces--x0-w0-and-ranges) |
| `\`            | escapes the next character (`\x` → a literal `x`)                            |
| anything else  | a literal: dash, dot, space, brackets — printed as-is                        |

The same digits under two patterns:

```xml
<sequence name="Ssn">
  <gen type="text" value="378984323,889735724,852139753,263243158" order="sequential"/>
</sequence>
...
<data>${{Ssn}}  ->  ${{Ssn | mask:xxx-xx-xxxx}}   |   ${{Ssn | mask:xxx.xx.xxxx}}</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
378984323  ->  378-98-4323   |   378.98.4323
889735724  ->  889-73-5724   |   889.73.5724
852139753  ->  852-13-9753   |   852.13.9753
263243158  ->  263-24-3158   |   263.24.3158
```

On the left is the raw value, then the same SSN under two masks. Swap the separators
in the pattern and you get a different look — **same data**.

### The `w` slot — work by words

**Problem.** Starting from `first last`, you need to assemble your own layout. The `w`
slot takes a word and swallows one space after it:

```xml
<sequence name="Name"><gen type="text" value="james miller,mary jones,anna lee" order="sequential"/></sequence>
...
<data>${{Name}}  ->  ${{Name | mask:w:w}}</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
james miller  ->  james:miller
mary jones    ->  mary:jones
anna lee      ->  anna:lee
```

`w` grabbed `james`, ate the space, printed the literal `:`, and the second `w` grabbed
`miller`. There's no space before the `:` — the first `w` swallowed it. The full
edge-case detail is on [`<mask>`](../compute/strings.md#reshaping).

## Moving pieces — `x[0]`, `w[0]` and ranges

**Problem.** The value arrives **whole** and in the wrong order. A name comes out of a
pack as `james miller`, but the export wants the surname first. A street address is
`12 Baker St`, and the country you're generating for writes the number last. The parts
were never yours to arrange: the string came out of a file column, a pack address, or a
regex, so you can't just generate two sequences and print them in the other order.

**Tool.** Put an index in brackets on a slot. It names a position in the **original**
input:

| Slot      | Takes                                                       |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x[7]`    | the character at index 7 — the eighth, counting from `x[0]` |
| `x[5..7]` | characters 5, 6 and 7 — **both** ends included              |
| `x[-1]`   | the last character                                          |
| `w[1]`    | the word at index 1 — the second                            |
| `w[-1]`   | the last word                                               |

Indices start at **0**, like the [`slice`](#slice--cut-a-part-by-index) filter. Ranges are
written with `..`, the same as everywhere else in TDC (`value="10..99"`,
`repeat="1..5"`) — a hyphen would be ambiguous next to `x[-1]`.

That's the entire addition to the syntax. Two examples, both real problems:

```xml
<data>${{Name}}  ->  ${{Name | mask:w[-1], w[0]}}</data>
<data>${{Addr}}  ->  ${{Addr | mask:w[1..-1] w[0]}}</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
james miller   ->  miller, james
mary jones     ->  jones, mary
anna lee       ->  lee, anna

12 Baker St -> Baker St 12
7 Elm Road -> Elm Road 7
140 Oak Lane -> Oak Lane 140
```

Neither one depends on how long the words are — that's the point of counting words
rather than characters. `w[-1]` is the last word whether the name has two parts or
four, and `w[1..-1]` is "everything except the first".

### What actually happens: the pool

A mask with an index does two separate things that don't interfere with each other.

*ABCDE under the mask x[4]-xxxx. The indexed slot pulls one character to the front; the bare slots then take what's left, in their original order.*

- **A** — the original value, each position numbered
- **B** — what the mask produced
- **drawn** — the position an index named, and where it landed
- **made** — what the bare slots took, in their original order

The first is **what gets printed**: an index reads that position of the original, and
nothing can change that. The second is **what the bare `x` / `w` / `*` slots still have
to work with** — and that's the only thing consumption affects. A position an index has
taken is out of the pool:

*The same run, seen as the pool: before the indexed pick, and after it.*

- **A** — the original value, before the indexed pick
- **B** — the pool the bare slots draw from — the position an index took is gone
- **drawn** — the position x[4] named

This is why `*` is worth a second look: it means **everything not yet consumed**, not
"the tail of the string". Move two digits to the front and `*` still prints the other
nine:

```xml
<data>${{Phone}}  ->  ${{Phone | mask:x[9]x[10] xxx-xxx-xxx}}</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
26324315851  ->  51 263-243-158
19875550142  ->  42 198-755-501
44207946001  ->  01 442-079-460
```

### The same index twice — a copy instead of a move

Nothing stops two slots from naming the same position. When they do, that part is
**printed twice** — which is how you get a warehouse code whose head repeats at the
tail:

*AB1234 under x[0..1]-*-x[0..1]. Two arrows leave the same two cells: the head is printed at the front and again at the end.*

- **A** — the original code, each position numbered
- **B** — the result — ten characters out of six
- **drawn** — the two characters named twice, printed at both ends
- **made** — the rest, taken by * in their original order

```xml
<data>${{Sku}}  ->  ${{Sku | mask:x[0..1]-*-x[0..1]}}</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
AB1234  ->  AB-1234-AB
CD5678  ->  CD-5678-CD
EF9012  ->  EF-9012-EF
```

Which brings up the one thing the notation can't tell you on its own: **`x[2]` doesn't
say whether it's a move or a copy.** It's a copy if some other slot names that position
too, and a move if none does. You find that out by reading the whole mask, not the one
slot.

> [!NOTE]
> **A descending range runs backwards**
>
> `x[-1..0]` means "from the last character to the first" — a reversal that doesn't care
> how long the value is. `AB1234` becomes `4321BA`. Useful for building deliberately
> mangled test data; not something to reach for otherwise.

### Three things that will catch you

**A bracket is an index only right after `x` or `w`.** Anywhere else it's an ordinary
literal, so `mask="[tel.] xxx-xxx"` needs no escaping at all. If you do want a literal
bracket directly after a slot, escape it: `mask="x[1]\[*\]"` on `ABC` gives `B[AC]`.

**An index past the end prints nothing, silently.** `w[4]` on a two-word value gives an
empty string, exactly like an `x` past the end of a short value. The input length isn't
known until the row is generated, so there's nothing to check in advance — and killing a
million-row run over one short value would be worse. Watch for empty cells when you use
a fixed index on data whose shape varies; `w[-1]` is usually the safer way to say "the
last one".

**A hyphen in a range is refused, not guessed.** `x[1-2]` is the easy typo, and if it
were treated as literal text it would quietly produce wrong data. You get
[`TDC199`](../reference/errors.md) instead, reported before a single row is
generated:

`./run demo.tdc`

```
error[TDC199]: mask: invalid index "[1-2]" after "x" — use x[0], x[0..4] or x[-1]
```

## Case — upper / lower / capitalize / title

**Problem.** Data arrives in mixed case, from different sources and imports:
`iPhone CASE`, `mary JONES`. You need one consistent form.

| Name         | Does                                                    |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `upper`      | ALL UPPERCASE                                           |
| `lower`      | all lowercase                                           |
| `capitalize` | **only the first** letter uppercase, the rest as-is     |
| `title`      | the first letter of **each word** uppercase, rest as-is |

The same string through all four:

```xml
<sequence name="W"><gen type="text" value="iPhone CASE,mary JONES,ANNA von lee" order="sequential"/></sequence>
...
<data>${{W}}  ->  upper=${{W | upper}} | lower=${{W | lower}} | capitalize=${{W | capitalize}} | title=${{W | title}}</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
iPhone CASE   ->  upper=IPHONE CASE | lower=iphone case | capitalize=IPhone CASE | title=IPhone CASE
mary JONES    ->  upper=MARY JONES | lower=mary jones | capitalize=Mary JONES | title=Mary JONES
ANNA von lee  ->  upper=ANNA VON LEE | lower=anna von lee | capitalize=ANNA von lee | title=ANNA Von Lee
```

`capitalize` touches only the very first character (`iPhone CASE` stays almost as-is —
its leading `i` becomes `I`), while `title` raises the first letter of **every** word
(`von` → `Von`, `lee` → `Lee`). `upper` and `lower` change everything.

### Different case by condition, on the same data

Because formatting happens on output, you can apply a **different** case per row to the
same generator — say male surnames capitalized and female ones in all caps:

```xml
<line if="Gender == M"><data>${{Gender}} ${{Word}}  ->  ${{Word | capitalize}}</data></line>
<line if="Gender == F"><data>${{Gender}} ${{Word}}  ->  ${{Word | upper}}</data></line>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
F miller  ->  MILLER
M miller  ->  Miller
F jones   ->  JONES
F brown   ->  BROWN
M davis   ->  Davis
M jones   ->  Jones
```

There's one generator, `Word`, but how it looks depends on `Gender`. You can't do this
inside the generator itself — formatting on output does it in a single line.

## As a `<gen>` attribute — format the whole column

**Problem.** You don't want to wrap every substitution — you want the **whole** column
to come out already formatted.

**Tool.** Put `mask="…"` or `case="…"` right on the [`<gen>`](../generators/overview.md).
On the left is the generator without the attribute (raw); on the right is the same one
with `mask=`:

```xml
<sequence name="Raw"><gen type="text" value="378984323,889735724,852139753,263243158" order="sequential"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Nice"><gen type="text" value="378984323,889735724,852139753,263243158" order="sequential" mask="xxx-xx-xxxx"/></sequence>
...
<data>${{Raw}}  ->  ${{Nice}}</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
378984323  ->  378-98-4323
889735724  ->  889-73-5724
852139753  ->  852-13-9753
263243158  ->  263-24-3158
```

This is exactly how you give a preset generator its "pretty" look:

```xml
<gen type="template" value="usa.docs.ssn" mask="xxx-xx-xxxx"/>
<gen type="template" value="common.payment.card.pan" mask="xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx"/>
```

Both addresses come from the [`template`](../generators/template.md#technical-identifiers)
generator. If both attributes are set, the order is **mask first, then case**.

## Filter chains — several operations in a row

**Problem.** You need more than one transform — say, reshape with a mask **and** raise
the case.

**Tool.** Pipe filters one after another with `|`, left to right — raw → mask → case:

```xml
<sequence name="Name"><gen type="text" value="james miller,mary jones,anna lee" order="sequential"/></sequence>
...
<data>${{Name}}  ->  ${{Name | mask:w:w}}  ->  ${{Name | mask:w:w | upper}}</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
james miller  ->  james:miller  ->  JAMES:MILLER
mary jones    ->  mary:jones    ->  MARY:JONES
anna lee      ->  anna:lee      ->  ANNA:LEE
```

The middle column is the value after the mask; the right one is after the mask **and**
`upper`. Each filter takes the previous one's result.

> [!NOTE]
> A mask argument reads up to the next `|` or the closing `}}`, so spaces and colons live
> happily inside it (`mask:w:w`, `mask:xxx-xx-xxxx`).

## More filters: slice, replace, trim, group

These use **two** of the three routes — the filter and the
[`<compute>`](../compute/strings.md) tag. `mask` and `case` are the only two of the
family that exist as `<gen>` attributes; writing `slice=` or `trim=` on a `<gen>` is
`TDC015`, so for the rest, format where the value is printed. Each one below follows
raw → tool → result, with a variation.

### `slice` — cut a part by index

**Problem.** From the date `2020-05-14` you need only the year, or only the month.

```xml
<sequence name="D"><gen type="text" value="2020-05-14,2022-11-03,2021-07-19" order="sequential"/></sequence>
...
<data>${{D}}  ->  year=${{D | slice:0,4}} | month=${{D | slice:5,7}} | tail=${{D | slice:5}}</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
2020-05-14  ->  year=2020 | month=05 | tail=05-14
2022-11-03  ->  year=2022 | month=11 | tail=11-03
2021-07-19  ->  year=2021 | month=07 | tail=07-19
```

`slice:0,4` is characters 0–3 (the year), `slice:5,7` is 5–6 (the month), and `slice:5`
with no second number means "from 5 to the end". The indices are character positions,
counting from zero. See [`<slice>`](../compute/strings.md#reshaping).

### `replace` — replace every occurrence

**Problem.** The date has dashes, but you need a different separator.

```xml
<data>${{D}}  ->  slash=${{D | replace:-,/}} | dot=${{D | replace:-,.}}</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
2020-05-14  ->  slash=2020/05/14 | dot=2020.05.14
2022-11-03  ->  slash=2022/11/03 | dot=2022.11.03
2021-07-19  ->  slash=2021/07/19 | dot=2021.07.19
```

The format is `replace:from,to`, and **all** occurrences are replaced. Three things it
does not do, each of which fails quietly rather than loudly:

- **`from` is matched literally, never as a regular expression.** `replace:[abc],Z`
  looks for the five characters `[abc]` and, finding none, changes nothing.
- **`from` cannot contain a comma.** The first comma ends it, so everything after
  belongs to `to` — `replace:-,+,x` replaces each `-` with `+,x`.
- **An empty `from` is refused.** `replace:,+` and `replace` on their own have nothing to
  look for, so [TDC275](../reference/errors.md) stops the run rather than letting the
  filter do nothing quietly. To DELETE, give the second part instead: `replace:-,`.

Where any of those matter, use the [`<replace>`](../compute/strings.md#reshaping) tag
in `<compute>` instead: it takes `from=` and `to=` as separate attributes, so a comma is
just a character.

### `trim` — strip outer spaces

**Problem.** Data from a file or a CSV sometimes carries stray spaces at the edges. Here
the spaces are added on purpose, as if they'd come in from a source, and the brackets in
the text are only there to make them visible:

```xml
<sequence name="City"><gen type="text" value="Austin,Denver,Boston" order="sequential"/></sequence>
<!-- glue extra spaces on the edges, imitating "dirty" data -->
<sequence name="Padded">
  <compute><result><concat><str v="  "/><field name="City"/><str v="   "/></concat></result></compute>
</sequence>
...
<data>[${{Padded}}]  ->  [${{Padded | trim}}]</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
[  Austin   ]  ->  [Austin]
[  Denver   ]  ->  [Denver]
[  Boston   ]  ->  [Boston]
```

Only the edges are touched — spaces inside the value are left alone. See
[`<trim>`](../compute/strings.md#reshaping).

### `group` — group digits from the right

**Problem.** A long number is unreadable: `1234567`.

```xml
<sequence name="N"><gen type="text" value="1234567,89150000,42" order="sequential"/></sequence>
...
<data>${{N}}  ->  group:3=${{N | group:3}} | group:3,-=${{N | group:3,-}} | group:4=${{N | group:4}}</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
1234567   ->  group:3=1 234 567 | group:3,-=1-234-567 | group:4=123 4567
89150000  ->  group:3=89 150 000 | group:3,-=89-150-000 | group:4=8915 0000
42        ->  group:3=42 | group:3,-=42 | group:4=42
```

Grouping runs from the **right**, so the short group ends up on the left (`1 234 567`).
`group:3` gives you thousands (the default separator is a space), `group:3,-` sets your
own separator, and `group:4` reads like the blocks on a card. `42` is shorter than a
single group, so it comes back unchanged. See
[`<group>`](../compute/strings.md#reshaping).

A **decimal number** is grouped the way a person groups one: the digits before the
separator, and nowhere else — `1234567.89` becomes `1 234 567.89`, and a leading `-`
stays outside the grouping. Only that exact shape counts as a number, so a card number
and any other string keep the plain right-to-left chunking.

The argument is checked before the run. `slice:5,2` ends before it starts and would have
emptied the column; `group:0`, `compact:1` and `compact:99` are numbers the filter cannot
use and would have passed the value through unchanged; `trim:junk` puts an argument on a
filter that reads none. All five used to be accepted in silence — the config said one
thing and the output did another. They are now TDC273, TDC274 and TDC275.

## Order — `order="sequential"`

**Problem.** By default, [`text`](../generators/text.md) and
[`file`](../generators/file.md) pick values **at random**. Sometimes the data has an
order you meant to keep — a list in a file, a numbered series.

**Tool.** `order="sequential"`: row `i` takes the `i`-th value in order, **cycling** when
it runs off the end. On the left is the ordinary (random) generator; on the right is the
same list, `Jan,Feb,Mar`, in order:

```xml
<sequence name="Rand"><gen type="text" value="Jan,Feb,Mar"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Seq"><gen type="text" value="Jan,Feb,Mar" order="sequential"/></sequence>
...
<data>random=${{Rand}}   sequential=${{Seq}}</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
random=Feb   sequential=Jan
random=Feb   sequential=Feb
random=Mar   sequential=Mar
random=Jan   sequential=Jan
random=Jan   sequential=Feb
random=Feb   sequential=Mar
random=Mar   sequential=Jan
```

The right column runs strictly `Jan, Feb, Mar, Jan, Feb, Mar, Jan…` — around and around.

- `order="random"` — the default.
- `order="sequential"` — strictly in order, cycling.
- `cycle="false"` — fail with a clear error when the data runs out, instead of cycling.
- It works the same way for files: `<gen type="file" src="@data/cities.txt" order="sequential"/>`
  emits the file's lines strictly in the order they appear in.

## `compact` — a long number, written short

This turns an integer into base-36 (digits plus lowercase letters). It is useful when a
number is a **unique tail** that a person still has to read:

```xml
<data>${{F|lower}}.${{L|lower}}.${{Id|compact}}@example.com</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
james.miller.1@example.com          <- first row
mary.jones.lfls@example.com         <- millionth
david.brown.x2qxvk@example.com      <- two-billionth
```

|            Number |   Decimal |            `compact` |
| ----------------: | --------: | -------------------: |
|         1,000,000 |  7 digits |     `lfls` — 4 chars |
|     2,000,000,000 | 10 digits |   `x2qxvk` — 6 chars |
| 1,000,000,000,000 | 13 digits | `cre66i9s` — 8 chars |

Six characters cover 2.17 billion rows, and seven cover 78 billion. The mapping is
one-to-one, so different numbers always give different strings — the uniqueness you
added the number for survives intact.

> [!NOTE]
> **Lowercase only, deliberately.** Base-62 (with capitals) would be shorter still, but
> plenty of systems lowercase email addresses — `aB` and `Ab` would then collapse into one
> address, and the duplicates would come back silently.

Set the base with `compact:16` (hex). A value that isn't an integer is left untouched.

## Escaping for a format: `csv` and `sql`

`<data>` builds **text** and knows nothing about the file you're writing, so a value
with a comma in it silently splits a CSV row, and an apostrophe breaks SQL. This isn't
theory: one product name like `Knife set, 3 pcs` can turn thousands of rows into records
with an extra field — category slides into price, price into quantity, and not a single
error is raised. Two filters close both holes.

### `csv` — an RFC 4180 field

```xml
<data>${{Id}},${{Name | csv}},${{Category}}</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
7,"Knife set, 3 pcs",Kitchen
2,"Coffee ""Arabica"" 250g",Grocery
```

Quotes are **always** added, not added "when needed" — a rule with no exceptions beats a
guess that eventually runs into a comma or a newline, and any CSV reader takes the extra
quotes in stride. See also [Output formats → CSV](../guides/output-formats.md#csv).

The filter accepts a delimiter — `csv:;` — and **does not read it**. Because the quoting
is unconditional, the delimiter cannot change the answer; the argument is allowed so a
semicolon file can say so at the call site, and it is the one filter argument that is
deliberately ignored rather than [refused](../reference/errors.md).

One thing the filter deliberately does **not** do: values starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or
`@` become live formulas when the file is opened in a spreadsheet. Generated data keeps
its bytes as generated — if your file is destined for Excel and that matters, prefix
such values yourself with a `replace` filter.

### `sql` — the body of a string literal

```xml
<data>INSERT INTO t VALUES ('${{Last | sql}}');</data>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
INSERT INTO t VALUES ('O''Brien');
```

The filter doubles the apostrophe and returns **only the contents**, with no outer
quotes — you write those yourself, so the shape of the query stays visible in the config.
For [JSON](../guides/output-formats.md#json) there's no separate filter: escape the
quote with a backslash using the same `replace` filter.

This is **standard-SQL** quoting (PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, ANSI). MySQL in its
default mode also treats `\` as an escape character — either enable
`NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES` there, or double backslashes yourself with `replace` first.
