# Missing data — `missing`

**Use it when** you need to test how your code copes with holes. Real data is
almost never complete: a phone number was never entered, an income went missing, a
field is just blank. If you only ever test on "perfect" rows, the first null in
production breaks everything. The `missing` attribute mixes blanks in **on purpose**
so you can see the failure before your users do.

`missing` is a cross-cutting attribute — it works on **any**
[`<gen>`](../generators/overview.md), whatever it generates.

Example outputs below are illustrative: the exact rows a given `seed` produces
can shift between core versions, but the behavior the attribute guarantees does
not.

*The same generator, 80 rows, with each modifier switched on in turn.*

- **A** — the clean series
- **B** — with anomaly= — the marked points are the injected outliers
- **C** — with missing= — the marks on the floor are rows that produced no value

## How to turn it on

Put `missing="p"` on a `<gen>`, where `p` is a fraction from `0` to `1` — the
share of values that become empty:

```xml
<gen type="number" value="30000..90000" missing="0.3"/>
```

Roughly 30% of the incomes come out empty; the rest are ordinary numbers.

Each value is dropped **independently** with that probability. In statistics this
is called **MCAR** — Missing Completely At Random — the blanks fall without regard
to any other field or to the value itself.

By default a missing value is an **empty string**. Want your own marker (`NULL`,
`NA`, `—`)? Set `missing_as` — [see below](#a-visible-marker--missing_as).

## Before and after — what a blank actually changes

**The problem.** Until you see the same field "whole" and "holey" side by side,
it's hard to tell what's happening: which value was lost, and which was never
there.

**The tool.** Take one list of cities and make **two** columns from it: `Full` as-is,
and `Holey` — the same list with `missing`.
[`order="sequential"`](masks-and-case.md) walks the list strictly in order, so
both columns line up row for row and you see exactly what dropped out:

```xml
<env count="8" seed="rec">
  <sequence name="Full"> <gen type="text" value="Austin,Denver,Boston,Seattle,Chicago,Dallas,Portland,Miami" order="sequential"/></sequence>
  <sequence name="Holey"><gen type="text" value="Austin,Denver,Boston,Seattle,Chicago,Dallas,Portland,Miami" order="sequential" missing="0.4"/></sequence>
</env>
...
<data>full=${{Full}} | holey=${{Holey}}</data>
```

`./run cities.tdc (count=8, seed=rec)`

```
full=Austin | holey=Austin
full=Denver | holey=
full=Boston | holey=
full=Seattle | holey=
full=Chicago | holey=Chicago
full=Dallas | holey=Dallas
full=Portland | holey=Portland
full=Miami | holey=Miami
```

Everything is in place on the left; on the right, the **same** rows — but `Denver`,
`Boston`, and `Seattle` have vanished. The value wasn't swapped for another one, and
nothing shifted up to fill the gap: the cell became empty. (On 8 rows at
`missing="0.4"` three dropped — the share is random, and on a small sample the spread
is wide.)

## A visible marker — `missing_as`

**The problem.** An empty string is invisible in an export: in a CSV it's just
"nothing between two commas," and you can't tell a blank from a short value by
looking. Real datasets usually flag a hole explicitly — `NULL`, `NA`, `—`.

**The tool.** `missing_as="marker"` prints your text where the blank would be.
The rows that go missing are **the same ones** (they're chosen by the `seed` and
the column name, not by the marker); only what fills the hole changes:

> [!NOTE]
> **The marker is formatted like any other value**
>
>
> `mask=` and `case=` run **after** the hole is filled, so they reshape the marker too:
> `missing_as="n/a" case="upper"` writes `N/A`. Write the marker as you want it to appear,
> and if a mask would mangle it, put the formatting on a separate sequence.
>

```xml
<sequence name="Holey">
  <gen type="text" value="Austin,Denver,Boston,Seattle,Chicago,Dallas,Portland,Miami"
       order="sequential" missing="0.4" missing_as="NULL"/>
</sequence>
```

`./run cities.tdc (missing_as=NULL)`

```
full=Austin | holey=Austin
full=Denver | holey=NULL
full=Boston | holey=NULL
full=Seattle | holey=NULL
full=Chicago | holey=Chicago
full=Dallas | holey=Dallas
full=Portland | holey=Portland
full=Miami | holey=Miami
```

The holes are on the same rows — 2, 3 and 4 — as before, where `Denver`, `Boston` and
`Seattle` were: adding the marker moved nothing. Set `missing_as="—"` or
`missing_as="NA"` and you get your own marker in the same places.

## How many holes — varying the rate

**The problem.** You want to know how the system behaves under "rare" blanks and
under "frequent" ones. A single rate won't show you that.

**The tool.** Change only `missing`, keep everything else the same. `X` is a value
in place, `[]` is a hole. Three columns, 20 rows:

```xml
<env count="20" seed="demo">
  <sequence name="A"><gen type="text" value="X" order="sequential" missing="0.1"/></sequence>
  <sequence name="B"><gen type="text" value="X" order="sequential" missing="0.3"/></sequence>
  <sequence name="C"><gen type="text" value="X" order="sequential" missing="0.6"/></sequence>
</env>
...
<data>0.1:[${{A}}]  0.3:[${{B}}]  0.6:[${{C}}]</data>
```

`./run rates.tdc (count=20, seed=demo)`

```
0.1:[X]  0.3:[X]  0.6:[]
0.1:[X]  0.3:[]  0.6:[X]
0.1:[X]  0.3:[X]  0.6:[X]
0.1:[X]  0.3:[]  0.6:[X]
0.1:[X]  0.3:[]  0.6:[]
0.1:[X]  0.3:[]  0.6:[X]
0.1:[X]  0.3:[X]  0.6:[]
0.1:[]  0.3:[X]  0.6:[]
0.1:[X]  0.3:[X]  0.6:[]
0.1:[X]  0.3:[X]  0.6:[X]
0.1:[]  0.3:[X]  0.6:[X]
0.1:[X]  0.3:[X]  0.6:[X]
0.1:[X]  0.3:[X]  0.6:[]
0.1:[X]  0.3:[X]  0.6:[]
0.1:[X]  0.3:[]  0.6:[]
0.1:[X]  0.3:[X]  0.6:[]
0.1:[X]  0.3:[X]  0.6:[X]
0.1:[X]  0.3:[X]  0.6:[X]
0.1:[X]  0.3:[X]  0.6:[]
0.1:[X]  0.3:[X]  0.6:[X]
```

Count the empty `[]` down each column: `0.1` → 2 holes out of 20, `0.3` → 5,
`0.6` → 10. Raise the rate and the holes multiply. The rate × 20 would be
2 / 6 / 12, and only the first column landed on it: each value is dropped
independently, so over 20 rows the count varies around the expected number
rather than hitting it. Over 20,000 rows it lands much closer.

## Missing across several fields

`missing` **combines with anything** — a plain range, a
[`template`](../generators/template.md), a [`regex`](../generators/regex.md)
pattern, a statistical distribution. Here's a record built from three fields: a
name (no blanks), a phone (`missing="0.3"`, marker `N/A`), and an income
(`missing="0.25"`, with the default empty marker):

```xml
<env count="8" seed="demo">
  <sequence name="Name">   <gen type="template" value="person.male.firstName"/></sequence>
  <sequence name="Phone">  <gen type="regex" value="\+1 \(555\) [0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}" missing="0.3" missing_as="N/A"/></sequence>
  <sequence name="Income"> <gen type="number" value="30000..90000" missing="0.25"/></sequence>
</env>
...
<data>${{Name}} | phone: ${{Phone}} | income: ${{Income}}</data>
```

`./run record.tdc (count=8, seed=demo)`

```
Richard | phone: +1 (555) 226-8995 | income: 38370
David | phone: +1 (555) 067-4473 | income: 70315
Joseph | phone: N/A | income: 41008
William | phone: N/A | income: 85063
John | phone: +1 (555) 528-7933 | income: 
Michael | phone: +1 (555) 140-4007 | income: 48334
James | phone: N/A | income: 46153
Robert | phone: N/A | income: 33986
```

Some rows have `N/A` for the phone; row 5 has an empty income (the default marker
is nothing at all). The blanks in the two fields are **independent**: a hole in
one column tells you nothing about the other.

## Which rows may go missing — `missing_when`

`missing="p"` on its own drops values without regard to anything else. That is one
of the three ways real data goes missing, and the least interesting: the holes
carry no information, so nothing can be learnt from them and nothing can be
predicted about them.

`missing_when="…"` adds the other two. It is a condition, written in the same
[expression language](../reference/expressions.md) as `if=`, and it decides
which rows are **eligible** at all. `missing="p"` still decides how often an
eligible row actually goes blank.

| What you write | What it is called | Where the hole comes from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `missing="0.2"` | **MCAR** | nothing — every row is equally likely |
| `missing="0.8" missing_when="Age < 30"` | **MAR** | **another column** you can still see |
| `missing="0.8" missing_when="_value > 60000"` | **MNAR** | **the value itself**, which is now gone |

The names matter because they decide what a model trained on the file can be
scored on. MCAR holes teach nothing. MAR holes are predictable from what is still
in the row — an imputation step has something to work with. MNAR holes are
predictable only from what was taken away, which is the hard case, and the one
your pipeline is most likely to get wrong.

### MAR — the hole depends on another column

```xml
<sequence name="Age"><gen type="number" value="18..70"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Income">
    <gen type="number" value="30000..90000" missing="0.8" missing_as="NULL" missing_when="Age < 30"/>
</sequence>
```

`./run mar.tdc (count=8, seed=ages)`

```
age: 66 | income: 33520
age: 56 | income: 76606
age: 28 | income: NULL
age: 26 | income: NULL
age: 67 | income: 40610
age: 33 | income: 86092
age: 68 | income: 86789
age: 18 | income: NULL
```

Every blank sits on a row under 30; nobody older lost their income. `Age` is read
exactly the way `if="Age < 30"` would read it, so the same rules apply: the column
must be declared **above** the one that names it.

### MNAR — the hole depends on the value that is now gone

Inside `missing_when`, `_value` is the value this generator produced for the row —
what the blank would have hidden. It is a name the language provides, like
`_count` and `_last`; no config declares it.

```xml
<sequence name="Income">
    <gen type="number" value="30000..90000" missing="0.8" missing_as="NULL" missing_when="_value > 60000"/>
</sequence>
```

`./run mnar.tdc (count=8, seed=mnar)`

```
income: NULL
income: 53006
income: 52544
income: NULL
income: 52481
income: NULL
income: NULL
income: 35921
```

Every surviving income is under 60,000. The high earners are the ones who did not
answer — which is exactly the bias MNAR names, and exactly what a model trained on
the visible rows cannot see.

`_value` is the value **after** [`anomaly=`](anomalies.md) has run, because that
is the value the row would have carried. So `missing_when="_value > 150000"`
beside an `anomaly=` blanks the spikes, and the `anomaly_flag` column agrees: a
blanked cell has no spike left to label.

### The small print

- **A rate is still required.** `missing_when` without `missing` decides nothing,
  and is refused rather than ignored.
- **A bare word is a literal**, here as everywhere else in the language:
  `missing_when="Tier == hi"` compares against the word `hi`. A misspelled column
  name is reported (`TDC215`) rather than quietly read as a word.
- **Not with `repeat=`.** A repeated cell holds several values on one row and the
  condition asks about one; rather than guess which reading you meant, the
  combination is refused.
- **Both engines.** The condition is evaluated per row against the same column
  reader both engines use, so a streamed run and an in-memory one produce the same
  file.

## Details

- **Deterministic.** The same `seed` produces the same blanks — see
  [Determinism & proportions](../core-concepts/determinism.md). One "holey"
  dataset reproduces byte for byte, run after run.
- **Both engines, any volume.** Blanks are decided by row number, so memory
  doesn't grow with the dataset — see
  [Large outputs & streaming](large-outputs.md).
- **`missing="0"`** means no blanks at all — exactly as if the attribute weren't
  there.
