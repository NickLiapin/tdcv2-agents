# Signals from formulas — a heartbeat, drawn by arithmetic

Most columns in a config are **drawn**: a name from a pack, a number from a range, a date
from a window. A signal is different. Its value at any instant is not a choice — it follows
from where you are in time. That makes it a job for
[`<gen type="formula">`](../generators/formula.md), and it is the one construct that can
produce a shape rather than a bag of values.

This guide builds a synthetic electrocardiogram: a two-column CSV that draws a recognizable
heartbeat when you plot it. The same method fits any repeating measurement — a vibration
trace, a daily temperature curve, hourly traffic on a road.

## A heartbeat is five bells

One heartbeat is five bumps in a row, and each bump is the same shape: a bell, tall in the
middle and fading to nothing on both sides. Three numbers describe one bell — how tall it
is, where its center sits, and how wide it spreads:

```
height * exp(-pow((position - center) / width, 2))
```

`exp` and `pow` are ordinary [expression functions](../reference/expressions.md), and they
behave the same in all five implementations. Change `center` and the bump slides along the
time axis. Change `width` and it gets narrower or flatter. Nothing else is needed.

## Time, and the beat it belongs to

Two columns turn a row counter into a clock. Sample 250 times a second, which is what a
real monitor does, so each row is 4 milliseconds:

```xml
<sequence name="T"><gen type="formula" expr="(_count - 1) * 4"/></sequence>
<sequence name="N"><gen type="formula" expr="floor(T / 1000)"/></sequence>
```

`_count` is the row number, so `T` is the time in milliseconds. `floor(T / 1000)` is the
**beat number**: it stays at 0 for a whole second, then becomes 1, then 2.

That second column is the useful one. Anything computed from `N` holds still for the length
of a beat and changes only at the boundary, which is how one beat comes out different from
the next without the bumps inside it wobbling.

## Where the beat starts

A beat does not have to begin on the whole second:

```xml
<sequence name="Onset"><gen type="formula" expr="N * 1000 + 45 * sin(N * 1.7)"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Phase"><gen type="formula" expr="T - Onset"/></sequence>
```

`Onset` is where beat `N` begins, pushed up to 45 milliseconds either side of the round
second. `Phase` is how far into its own beat the current row sits, and every bell is placed
against `Phase` rather than against the clock.

A heart speeds up as you breathe in and slows down as you breathe out, so the gap between
beats keeps moving by a few percent. A recording without that variation reads as a drawing
of a heartbeat rather than a measurement of one.

## The five bells, with real numbers

```xml
<sequence name="P"><gen type="formula" expr="0.12 * exp(-pow((Phase - 200) / 22, 2))"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Q"><gen type="formula" expr="-0.16 * exp(-pow((Phase - 372) / 10, 2))"/></sequence>
<sequence name="R"><gen type="formula" expr="Amp * exp(-pow((Phase - 400) / 8, 2))"/></sequence>
<sequence name="S"><gen type="formula" expr="-0.28 * exp(-pow((Phase - 428) / 12, 2))"/></sequence>
<sequence name="TW"><gen type="formula" expr="0.35 * exp(-pow((Phase - 620) / 45, 2))"/></sequence>
```

| Bell | Height, mV | Center, ms | Width, ms | What it is                        |
| :--- | ---------: | ---------: | --------: | :-------------------------------- |
| P    |       0.12 |        200 |        22 | the upper chambers contracting    |
| Q    |      −0.16 |        372 |        10 | a dip before the main spike       |
| R    |       1.20 |        400 |         8 | the ventricles firing             |
| S    |      −0.28 |        428 |        12 | the dip after it                  |
| T    |       0.35 |        620 |        45 | the ventricles recovering         |

Two of the numbers carry the character of the trace. `R` is eight milliseconds wide against
a beat of a thousand, which is why the spike is nearly vertical. `T` is 45, which is why the
last bump is a long low hill.

*One beat, taken apart. Every value comes from running the config below.*

- **faint** — the five bells, each one a column of its own
- **made** — their sum, the only column the file prints
- **A** — P — the upper chambers contract
- **B** — Q — the dip before the spike
- **C** — R — the ventricles fire
- **D** — S — the dip after
- **E** — T — the ventricles recover

The horizontal axis is milliseconds within one beat; the vertical is millivolts. **Five of
these columns are never printed.** A sequence that no `<block>` mentions still takes part in
the arithmetic, which is what lets a config carry its working out.

## Making it live

Two more columns keep every beat from being a copy of the last one:

```xml
<sequence name="Amp"><gen type="formula" expr="1.20 + 0.07 * sin(N * 2.3)"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Drift"><gen type="formula" expr="0.05 * sin(_count / 95)"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Noise"><gen type="number" distribution="normal" mean="0" sd="0.012" decimals="4"/></sequence>
```

`Amp` varies the height of the spike from beat to beat, because it reads `N`. `Drift` rocks
the baseline slowly, the way a chest rising and falling moves the electrodes. `Noise` is the
only **drawn** column on the page: normal, tiny, and different on every row, which is what a
real sensor adds.

*Five seconds. The spikes drift away from the second marks and back again.*

- **mark** — whole seconds
- **made** — the generated trace
- **A** — the mark at the third second
- **B** — the spike that misses it

Measured over ten seconds of this output, the gap between spikes runs from 932 to 1068
milliseconds — a pulse wandering between 56 and 64 beats per minute. That is the range a
resting adult shows.

> [!NOTE]

> Nothing in the wander is random. `sin(N * 1.7)` is arithmetic on the beat number, so the

Ten seconds of recording is 2,500 rows. The opening rows are the flat stretch before the
first beat, which is what a trace looks like between heartbeats. Load the file into a
spreadsheet, plot column B against column A as a line, and the shape appears.

## Turning the knobs

| To change             | Edit                            | Effect                                    |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------- |
| Heart rate            | `1000` in `Onset` and `N`       | `600` gives 100 beats per minute          |
| Sampling rate         | `4` in `T`                      | `2` gives 500 samples per second          |
| Strength of the spike | `1.20` in `Amp`                 | the height of R in millivolts             |
| Steadiness            | `45` in `Onset`                 | `0` makes every beat exactly a second     |
| Sensor quality        | `sd` on `Noise`                 | larger is a noisier recording             |

Setting the `45` to `0` is worth doing once. The trace stays correct and starts looking
manufactured, which shows how much of "realistic" lives in the irregularity rather than in
the shape.

## Where else this fits

The method is not about hearts. Anything that repeats with a period, varies a little each
cycle, and carries noise takes the same three parts: `floor` to number the cycles, a phase
inside the cycle, and bells or sines placed against that phase. Machine vibration, a daily
temperature curve, and hourly traffic counts are all built this way.

For a column that instead accumulates across rows, see
[`running`](../generators/running.md). For one figure computed over the whole run, see
[`stat`](../generators/stat.md).
