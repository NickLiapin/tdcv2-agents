# Typed output & Parquet

**Use it when** the file is headed for analysis — pandas, DuckDB, Spark, a data
warehouse — and you need it to carry **real column types** and a **real NULL**, not
just text that a reader has to guess at. Name your [`<data>`](../core-concepts/output-formatting.md)
columns, give the output a `.parquet` name, and TDC writes a binary, typed file — no
external libraries, no extra flags.

Every output so far on this site has been **text**: CSV, JSON, SQL. That's fine for
people and for anything that reads characters. For data analysis it has two problems
that Parquet solves.

- **No types.** In CSV everything is a string. A data scientist loads the file and has
  to guess all over again which column is a number, which is a date, which is plain
  text — and guesses wrong: `007` becomes `7`, and a document number is quietly
  corrupted.
- **No NULL.** Nothing between two commas — is that "empty text" or "no value at all"?
  [`missing`](../reference/attributes.md) emits an empty string, and the distinction
  is lost.

Parquet is the columnar binary format that analytics tools standardize on. Each column
has a **real type** and a **real NULL**, and the file opens in one line —
`pd.read_parquet("data.parquet")` — with nothing left to repair.

*How a typed file is laid out on disk. Schematic.*

- **A** — a row group: a slice of rows, assembled, written, and released
- **B** — the first column of that slice, stored on its own
- **C** — the second column
- **D** — the third — a reader that needs one column touches only its chunks

## Turning it on

Two things: mark which [`<data>`](../core-concepts/output-formatting.md) tags are
columns, and name the file `.parquet`.

**A column is a `<data>` with a `name` attribute.** Without `name` the tag stays
ordinary formatting text and never reaches the file. The type is set with `type`.

```xml
<block>
  <line>
    <data name="id"         type="int64">${{Id}}</data>
    <data name="reading"    type="int64">${{Reading}}</data>
    <data name="is_outlier" type="bool">${{IsOutlier}}</data>
    <data name="city"       type="string">${{City}}</data>
    <data name="amount"     type="int64|null">${{Amount}}</data>
  </line>
</block>
```

The format is chosen **by the file extension** — no new flag:

```bash
tdcv2 data.tdc -o data.parquet     # binary, typed
tdcv2 data.tdc -o data.csv         # text, exactly as before
```

Here is what someone opening the file sees — a schema (type per column), then the rows:

`./run data.tdc -o data.parquet   (schema + first rows)`

```
id          INT64       REQUIRED
reading     INT64       REQUIRED
is_outlier  BOOLEAN     REQUIRED
city        BYTE_ARRAY  REQUIRED  {"type":"STRING"}
amount      INT64       OPTIONAL

{"id":1,"reading":45, "is_outlier":false,"city":"Chicago","amount":2143}
{"id":2,"reading":54, "is_outlier":false,"city":"Chicago","amount":2328}
{"id":3,"reading":42, "is_outlier":false,"city":"Austin", "amount":5275}
{"id":4,"reading":42, "is_outlier":false,"city":"Denver", "amount":null}
{"id":5,"reading":540,"is_outlier":true, "city":"Denver", "amount":5787}
{"id":6,"reading":53, "is_outlier":false,"city":"Austin", "amount":3308}
```

Two details worth pausing on. `amount` on row 4 is a **real `null`** (the column is
`OPTIONAL`), not an empty string — [`missing`](../reference/attributes.md) finally
coming through the way it should. And `is_outlier` is a real `BOOLEAN`: a marker column
from [`anomaly_flag`](../reference/attributes.md), which gives you a labeled dataset
ready to test an anomaly detector against.

## The types you can write

| `type=`          | What it is            | Read from text                      |
| :--------------- | :-------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| `bool`           | true / false          | `true`/`false`, `1`/`0`             |
| `int32`          | 32-bit integer        | `-42`                               |
| `int64`          | 64-bit integer        | `9007199254740993` — exact          |
| `double`         | 8-byte float          | `3.14`, `1e3`                       |
| `string`         | UTF-8 text            | as-is                               |
| `date`           | calendar date         | `2020-05-14`                        |
| `timestamp`      | instant in time       | ISO-8601                            |
| `decimal(p,s)`   | exact decimal (money) | `123.45` — **no rounding**. Precision `1`–`18`, scale `0`–precision: the values are carried in an INT64, so 18 digits is the ceiling (`TDC194`) |
| `uuid`           | UUID as 16 bytes      | canonical form                      |
| `json`           | JSON                  | as-is                               |
| `float`          | 4-byte float          | `3.14` — half the space of `double` |
| `float16`        | 2-byte float          | `3.14` — ~3 significant digits      |
| `enum`           | enumerated text       | `RED` — a string, but tagged        |
| `uint8/16/32/64` | unsigned integer      | `255` — rejects a negative          |

Add `\|null` after the type to make the column **nullable**: `type="int64\|null"`.
Without it an empty value is an **error** — a free quality gate: if a column shouldn't
be empty, TDC says so.

> [!NOTE]
> **`decimal` never rounds silently**
>
> `decimal(18,2)` with the value `123.456` is an **error**, not a lost cent.

> [!NOTE]
> **Narrow floats lose precision on purpose**
>
> `float` and `float16` **deliberately** give up precision — that's the point: they take
> less space. `0.1` becomes `0.100000001490116` as a `float` and `0.0999755859375` as a

> statistics never describe numbers the file doesn't contain). Going out of range (`1e40`
> for `float`, `100000` for `float16`) is an error, not a silent infinity.

> [!NOTE]
> **Unsigned integers**
>
> `uint64` holds numbers up to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 — larger than `int64`. A
> negative value in such a column is an error.

## You can skip `type=` — TDC infers it

The engine knows **which generator produced a column**, so in most cases `type=` is
unnecessary. Here is a config with **no `type=` anywhere**:

```xml
<sequence name="Id"><gen type="increment" value="1"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Price"><gen type="number" value="1..999" decimals="2"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Qty"><gen type="number" value="1..99" missing="0.4"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Born"><gen type="date" range="1990-01-01..2000-12-31" format="YYYY-MM-DD"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Key"><gen type="template" value="common.id.uuid"/></sequence>
<sequence name="R"><gen type="number" value="10..20" anomaly="0.4" anomaly_flag="Flag"/></sequence>
...
<data name="id">${{Id}}</data>
<data name="price">${{Price}}</data>
<data name="qty">${{Qty}}</data>
<data name="born">${{Born}}</data>
<data name="key">${{Key}}</data>
<data name="flag">${{Flag}}</data>
```

What TDC worked out on its own:

`./run inferred.tdc -o inferred.parquet   (inferred schema)`

```
id     INT64                REQUIRED
price  DOUBLE               REQUIRED
qty    INT64                OPTIONAL
born   INT32                REQUIRED  {"type":"DATE"}
key    FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY REQUIRED  {"type":"UUID"}
flag   BOOLEAN              REQUIRED

{"id":1,"price":230,"qty":63, "born":"1996-05-25","key":"e96b21bc-...","flag":true}
{"id":2,"price":589,"qty":null,"born":"2000-05-01","key":"85caccad-...","flag":false}
```

The rules are simple: a [`number`](../generators/number.md) without `decimals` → integer,
with `decimals` → float; an [`increment`](../generators/counters.md) counter → integer;
`common.id.uuid` → UUID; an [`anomaly_flag`](../reference/attributes.md) marker column →
boolean, and so is a [`<mix flag=>`](../constructs/mix.md) column. And handily,
[`missing`](../reference/attributes.md) **makes the column nullable
on its own** (`qty` came out `OPTIONAL`).

**Computed columns are typed too**, by the same reasoning — what they can produce is
known before a single row exists:

| generator | column type |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| [`timeseries`](../generators/timeseries.md), [`pattern`](../generators/pattern.md) | integer, or float with `decimals` |
| [`running`](../generators/running.md) | the type of the column its `of=` names |
| [`stat`](../generators/stat.md) | `count` → integer; `mean`, `median`, `stddev` → float; `sum`, `min`, `max` → the source's type |
| [`formula`](../generators/formula.md) | integer or float **when `decimals=` is given**, text otherwise |
| [`file` with `read="quantile"`](../generators/file.md) | float, or integer with `decimals="0"` |
| [`increment` / `decrement`](../generators/counters.md) | integer, or float when `value=` or `step=` is fractional |
| [`<mix>`](../constructs/mix.md) | the shared type when **every** branch is a single `<gen>` that derives to it; `string` on any disagreement, or when a branch holds literal text. A `<mix flag=>` column is boolean |

The formula row is the odd one out on purpose. `expr="A + 1"` is a whole number,
`expr="A / 2"` is not, and `expr="A > 5 ? over : under"` is a WORD — so `decimals=` is
the one honest signal of what the column holds. Write `decimals="0"` when the answer is
whole and you want an integer column.

**The order is:** an explicit `type=`, then inference from the generator, then **text**.
TDC **never guesses a type from the values themselves** — that's exactly what corrupts
CSV (`007` → `7`). When TDC isn't sure, the column stays a string: a string breaks
nothing.

A [quantile read](../generators/file.md) is the one row on that table where the file
generator is typed at all, and for the usual reason: `read="quantile"` means the file has
to be numeric or the run refuses, so the column is a number **by construction** — a fact
about the generator, not a guess from the values. An ordinary file read is still text,
because a file is a bag of whatever the file holds.

Which number comes from the config alone, since this layer never opens the file.
`decimals="0"` is the one declaration that promises whole values; without it the precision
comes from the source and may be fractional, so the answer is a float. That is the safe
direction — a float holds every value such a column can produce, and `31` written as
`31.0` loses nothing, where text loses the type outright:

```xml
<sequence name="Amount"><gen type="file" src="amounts.txt" read="quantile"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Age"><gen type="file" src="ages.txt" read="quantile" decimals="0"/></sequence>
```

`amount` comes out `DOUBLE`, `age` comes out `INT64`. Declare `type=` by hand if you want
something narrower.

### Two cases where inference is deliberately skipped

- **A [`date`](../generators/date.md) without `format="YYYY-MM-DD"`.** By default a date
  prints as `05/25/1996`, which isn't ISO — calling that a `date` would be dishonest.
- **A [`mask`](masks-and-case.md) or [`case`](masks-and-case.md) on the generator.**
  These rewrite the text, so a number is no longer a number.

In both cases set `type=` by hand if you know what you're doing.

## When a value doesn't fit its type

TDC never writes a corrupt file — it stops and says exactly where:

`./run bad.tdc -o bad.parquet`

```
tdc: column "n", row 1: "abc" is not an integer (int64)
```

A typo in the **type name itself** is caught by the validator **before** generation
even starts (code `TDC194`).

## Large volumes — row groups

The file is written in **row groups** (50,000 rows each): a group is assembled, written,
and freed, so memory doesn't grow with the row count. 120,000 rows is three groups, and a
reader can **skip whole groups** without parsing the file end to end. This is the same
streaming behavior that keeps [large outputs](large-outputs.md) flat in memory.

Those same groups give you parallelism. A group's bytes **don't depend on where it sits**
in the file: page headers record the sizes, and every offset is collected in the footer.
Threads can therefore assemble groups independently. At the end a coordinator lays them
down back to back and writes a single footer with corrected offsets.

Work is split **by group, not by row** — cut a group in half and you'd get groups a
single-threaded run never produces. So the output is identical **byte for byte** at any
thread count. On a million rows:

`./run big.tdc -o big.parquet   (--jobs 1 / 4 / 8)`

```
--jobs 1    6.51 s
--jobs 4    2.51 s
--jobs 8    2.18 s      <- files of all three runs are identical
```

One condition: it needs a real file ([`-o`](../reference/cli.md)) — the `.parquet`
extension on that path is what selects the writer, and without `-o` the run prints text
instead. Parallel writing needs the file too: the coordinator has to know where each group
landed.
Set the thread count with [`--jobs`](../reference/cli.md) if you like; the bytes are the
same either way.

## Lists

A column can hold a **list of values** rather than one: `type="[]int64"`, or just
[`repeat`](../reference/attributes.md) on the generator, in which case the type is
inferred. An empty list, and a `null` inside a list, both come through faithfully.

```xml
<data name="scores" type="[]int64">${{Scores}}</data>
```

`./run lists.tdc -o lists.parquet`

```
scores  INT64  OPTIONAL  (repeated)

{"scores":[45,52,61]}
{"scores":[]}
{"scores":[70,null,55]}
```

## Fast queries — column statistics

For every column TDC records the **minimum, maximum, and NULL count**. That lets a
reader **skip whole blocks**: for a query like `amount > 500`, it checks the block's
maximum and, if that maximum is below 500, never parses the block at all.

Comparison follows the **format's** rules, not JavaScript's: strings compare **by their
UTF-8 bytes**. In ASCII an uppercase letter sorts before a lowercase one, so
`"Apple" < "apple" < "zebra"`, and any non-ASCII text sorts after all ASCII — a stable,
portable order every Parquet reader agrees on.

The file also declares that order in its footer (`column_orders`). Without that
declaration the format says a reader **must ignore** the bounds, however correct they
are — Java-based readers drop string min/max outright. TDC had been writing correct
bounds no reader was permitted to use; it now writes the declaration beside them.

## Repeated values are stored once

When a column has few distinct values — cities, statuses, categories — TDC stores them
with a **dictionary**: the list of values once, and each row a small number pointing into
it. The decision is automatic, made from the data. On 50,000 rows:

| column   | distinct values | dictionary        | size   |
| :------- | :-------------- | :---------------- | :----- |
| `city`   | 5               | **yes**           | 18 KB  |
| `status` | 3               | **yes**           | 12 KB  |
| `uuid`   | 50,000          | no — not worth it | 781 KB |

A dictionary would only hurt a column of unique values, so TDC doesn't build one there.
The rule is simple: use a dictionary when the distinct count is at most half the row
count — **except a `bool`, which never gets one**. A boolean already costs a bit, so a
dictionary could only add a page. Two distinct values over 2,000 rows is well under half
and still gets `PLAIN` alone, where an `int64` and a `string` beside it both get
`RLE_DICTIONARY`.

## Compression

Pages are compressed with **snappy** — the Parquet standard every reader understands. On
a real 50,000-row, 14-column set:

`ls -lh   (no compression vs. now)`

```
no compression, no dictionary:  5.70 MB
now:                            1.99 MB      <- nearly a third the size
```

Compression is chosen **per column, and only when it wins**. Snappy has overhead bytes,
and on a very small page they cost more than they save — TDC leaves such a column
uncompressed. A 5-value city column over 50,000 rows takes that route: 18,839 bytes in,
18,839 out, codec `UNCOMPRESSED`. A uuid column over the same rows goes the other way and
snappy saves 209 KB of 2 MB.

The decision is made on the page, not on the chunk, so a chunk that compresses to almost
nothing can still end a couple of bytes larger than it went in — one measured case is 99
bytes in and 101 out. Two bytes on a file that is otherwise a third of its raw size; worth
knowing, not worth avoiding.

It's implemented in TDC's own code, with no third-party library — and not just to keep the
dependency list short: two snappy implementations can emit **different** (though equally
valid) bytes for the same data, and a shared encoder is what lets all five
implementations produce byte-identical files at the same version.

## Reading it back in pandas

The payoff is on the reader's side. One line, and the frame already has the right dtypes
and real `NaN` where the file had `null` — nothing to clean:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_parquet("data.parquet")
print(df.dtypes)
```

`python read.py   (dtypes)`

```
id             int64
reading        int64
is_outlier      bool
city           object
amount        float64
dtype: object
```

`id` and `reading` are integers, `is_outlier` is a genuine boolean, `city` is text, and
`amount` — the nullable column — comes back as `float64` so it can hold `NaN` for the
missing rows (ask pandas for its nullable backend with
`pd.read_parquet(..., dtype_backend="numpy_nullable")` to keep it a nullable `Int64`).
The frame itself:

`python read.py   (df.head)`

```
   id  reading  is_outlier     city  amount
0   1       45       False  Chicago  2143.0
1   2       54       False  Chicago  2328.0
2   3       42       False   Austin  5275.0
3   4       42       False   Denver     NaN
4   5      540        True   Denver  5787.0
```

Row 4's `amount` is `NaN`, not an empty string — the `null` survived the round trip. For
the full library API in each language, see [Language bindings](../bindings/python.md).

## Maps

A column can hold a **map** — `type="{}int64"` is a map from text to `int64`. The
cell reads `key:value` pairs, separated the same way a list's elements are:

```xml
<data name="gauges" type="{}int64|null">cpu:${{Cpu}},mem:${{Mem}}</data>
```

`./run metrics.tdc -o metrics.parquet`

```
host    STRING  REQUIRED
gauges  MAP<STRING, INT64>  REQUIRED

{"host":"db-1",  "gauges":{"cpu":74,"mem":null}}
{"host":"db-1",  "gauges":{"cpu":65,"mem":43}}
{"host":"web-1", "gauges":{"cpu":15,"mem":15}}
{"host":"web-1", "gauges":{"cpu":10,"mem":12}}
{"host":"web-2", "gauges":{"cpu":6,"mem":null}}
```

The reader gets a real map, not a string it has to pull apart — `gauges['cpu']` is
a query, and `missing=` on the generator behind a value comes through as a genuine
`null` inside it.

**The key is always text.** Parquet does not allow a null key, a cell arrives as
text anyway, and a second type parameter would double the syntax to buy a
conversion nobody has asked for. So `{}T` reads "a map from text to T" and there
is nothing else to decide. `|null` binds to the VALUE, exactly as it binds to a
list's element.

### Writing the cell

- **The key is everything before the first `:`; the value is the rest.** So a
  value may hold colons — `start:12:30:00` is one pair — and a key may not.
- **An empty cell is an empty map**, the same rule a list follows.
- **Three things are refused** rather than guessed at, because each would leave
  you with a map quietly missing an entry: a piece with no `:` at all, an empty
  key, and a key that repeats inside one row (readers disagree about which of the
  two wins, and some drop the row's map entirely).

## Not yet supported

- **zstd / brotli compression** — snappy is here; these aren't yet.
- **Dictionaries for floating-point numbers** work, but the win is usually smaller —
  repeats among floats are rare.
- **Lists of lists** — `[]int64` and `{}int64` both work, but `[][]int64` does not:
  it would need a second separator, and no shape for one has earned its place yet.
- **Geometry types** — added one at a time; each is just a label over the same bytes.
