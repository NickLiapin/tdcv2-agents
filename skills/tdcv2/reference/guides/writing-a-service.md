# Writing a service generator

The [`http` generator](../generators/http.md) lets a service you wrote decide values.
This page is the other half: **how to write that service**, in any of five languages, so
that it is fast, correct, and **reproducible**. Reproducibility is the one that takes
deliberate work, because a service is free to answer differently every time it is asked.

Below is one working service per language. Each one covers both modes: it invents account
numbers when asked for values, and appends a Luhn check digit when handed values to
process.

## What the service must do

The full contract lives on the [generator's page](../generators/http.md#the-contract-your-service-implements).
Four lines of it are all you need to write one:

- a **`POST`** arrives, carrying `X-TDC-Count: N` and `X-TDC-Seed: <hex>`;
- the **body** is `N` values, one per line — or **empty**, which means "invent them";
- **`X-TDC-Input: N`** is present exactly when the caller sent inputs, and says how many
  lines the body holds. Reading it is optional and worth doing — see below;
- answer with exactly **`N` lines**, in the same order;
- plain text, no JSON needed anywhere.

**Match the header names case-insensitively**, as HTTP requires. The five implementations do
not spell them alike on the wire — Python's HTTP library canonicalises `X-TDC-Count` to
`X-Tdc-Count`, and so does Go's — and every helper used on this page (`self.headers.get` in
Python, `getRequestHeaders().getFirst` in Java, `req.headers` in Node) already ignores case.
A service that compares the name as a plain string will work with four runtimes and not the
fifth.

### Read `X-TDC-Input` if you can

"Empty body means invent the values" is true almost always, and wrong in one case: a
config whose `in=` column holds a single empty value sends an empty body too. Without the
header the two are indistinguishable, and a service that guessed "source" invented a value
where it had been asked to process one.

```js
const declared = req.headers['x-tdc-input'];      // undefined → the caller sent no inputs
const inputs =
  declared === undefined ? [] :
  Number(declared) === 0 ? [] :
  body.length === 0 ? [''] : body.split('\n');
```

A service that ignores the header keeps working exactly as before — which is why this is a
header and not a new body format.

## The service, in five languages

#### Node.js

```js
import { createServer } from 'node:http';

/** FNV-1a (32-bit). The same three lines in every language — that is the point. */
function fnv1a(text) {
  let h = 0x811c9dc5;
  for (const ch of Buffer.from(text, 'utf8')) {
    h ^= ch;
    h = Math.imul(h, 0x01000193) >>> 0; // Math.imul keeps it 32-bit
  }
  return h >>> 0;
}

/** Source mode: an 8-digit account for row `i`, decided only by (seed, i). */
function accountFor(seed, i) {
  return String(fnv1a(`${seed}#${i}`) % 100000000).padStart(8, '0');
}

/** Handler mode: the Luhn check digit of what was sent. */
function luhn(number) {
  let sum = 0;
  let dbl = true;
  for (let i = number.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    let d = number.charCodeAt(i) - 48;
    if (d < 0 || d > 9) continue;
    if (dbl) {
      d *= 2;
      if (d > 9) d -= 9;
    }
    sum += d;
    dbl = !dbl;
  }
  return String((10 - (sum % 10)) % 10);
}

createServer((req, res) => {
  const chunks = [];
  req.on('data', (c) => chunks.push(c));
  req.on('end', () => {
    const count = Number(req.headers['x-tdc-count'] ?? '0');
    const seed = String(req.headers['x-tdc-seed'] ?? '');
    const body = Buffer.concat(chunks).toString('utf8');

    const out =
      body.length === 0
        ? Array.from({ length: count }, (_, i) => accountFor(seed, i)) // source
        : body.split('\n').map((line) => line + luhn(line)); // handler

    const payload = out.join('\n');
    res.writeHead(200, {
      'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
      'Content-Length': Buffer.byteLength(payload),
    });
    res.end(payload);
  });
}).listen(5701, '127.0.0.1');
```

Run it with `cargo run`, then point `src` at `http://127.0.0.1:5705/`. No crates:
`wrapping_mul` gives the 32-bit arithmetic FNV-1a needs without a single dependency.

Any of the five, against the same config:

<!-- doc-check: skip needs one of this page's own services listening on 127.0.0.1:5701 -->

```xml
<tdc>
  <env count="3" seed="demo">
    <sequence name="Payload"><gen type="number" value="10000000..99999999"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Card"><gen type="http" src="http://127.0.0.1:5701/" in="Payload"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Acct"><gen type="http" src="http://127.0.0.1:5701/"/></sequence>
  </env>
  <block>
    <line><data>${{Payload}} -> ${{Card}}   |  account: ${{Acct}}</data></line>
  </block>
</tdc>
```

`./run demo.tdc`

```
10047634 -> 100476340   |  account: 71102997
48577070 -> 485770705   |  account: 54325378
44149883 -> 441498839   |  account: 37547759
```

`Card` went through the handler — the payload came back with its check digit. `Acct` was
invented from the seed alone. Swap the port for 5702, 5703, 5704 or 5705 and the output is
character for character the same.

## Reproducibility: what the seed is for

The `http` generator is the one place TDC [gives up its guarantee](../generators/http.md#what-it-does-not-promise):
the service decides the values, so the engine can't promise that a re-run produces the
same data. **Your service can promise it** — and `X-TDC-Seed` is what makes that possible.

The rule is one line: **derive every value from the seed, never from a clock or a random
number generator.**

```js
accountFor(seed, i); // reproducible — same seed, same row, same answer
Math.random(); // not
new Date(); // not
```

The seed TDC sends is stable across runs and **different for every sequence**, so two
`http` sequences pointed at one service never receive the same stream.

Written this way, the run reproduces:

`./run demo.tdc — twice`

```
run 1:  71102997  54325378  37547759
run 2:  71102997  54325378  37547759
```

### Compute each row directly, don't iterate

Note the shape of `accountFor(seed, i)`: it takes the **row index** and returns that
row's value, with no state carried between calls. That's deliberate, and worth copying.

A generator that walks a sequence — "call `next()` N times" — has to be called in the
right order, from the start, exactly once. A service can't guarantee any of that: the
engine may retry a request, and requests may arrive concurrently. A stateless function of
`(seed, i)` is immune to all of it, and it's no harder to write.

### The trap: 32 bits in five languages

For all five to agree, the arithmetic has to agree. This is where a naive port breaks,
and it comes down to one line per language:

| Language | What keeps the hash 32-bit                                                                |
| :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node     | `Math.imul(h, prime) >>> 0` — a plain `*` would go through a double and lose the low bits |
| Python   | `& 0xFFFFFFFF` — integers are arbitrary-precision, so nothing overflows on its own        |
| Java     | nothing — `int` multiplication already wraps                                              |
| C#       | `unchecked { … }` — outside it, .NET _throws_ on overflow instead of wrapping             |
| Rust     | `wrapping_mul` — a plain `*` _panics_ on overflow in a debug build                        |

Miss it in Python and the numbers grow forever, silently producing different values from
the rest. TDC's own engine has to solve exactly this problem: its PRNG is written in
terms of `Math.imul` and 32-bit operations precisely so that all five bindings agree —
which means the constraint isn't an artifact of this example.

All five services above were started and asked the same question — eight values, one
seed — and their replies compared:

```bash
for p in 5701 5702 5703 5704 5705; do
  curl -s -X POST -H "X-TDC-Count: 8" -H "X-TDC-Seed: demo" --data-binary "" \
    http://127.0.0.1:$p/ > out.$p.txt
done
```

`shasum -a 256 out.*.txt`

```
1d7bf9b2a4ef1ded8558cc0afd0ef18d15321a9da2398dc72c87cb8629c2ca2d  out.node.txt
1d7bf9b2a4ef1ded8558cc0afd0ef18d15321a9da2398dc72c87cb8629c2ca2d  out.py.txt
1d7bf9b2a4ef1ded8558cc0afd0ef18d15321a9da2398dc72c87cb8629c2ca2d  out.java.txt
1d7bf9b2a4ef1ded8558cc0afd0ef18d15321a9da2398dc72c87cb8629c2ca2d  out.cs.txt
1d7bf9b2a4ef1ded8558cc0afd0ef18d15321a9da2398dc72c87cb8629c2ca2d  out.rs.txt
```

Identical, not merely similar. If you port this to a sixth language, do the same check
before trusting it.

### The handler is usually reproducible already

Worth noting: `luhn()` never touches the seed. A handler computes its answer **from the
value you sent it**, so it's a pure function by nature — same input, same output, every
run. Only the **source** mode has to work at reproducibility.

## If the service is reachable by anyone else

A generator service usually does something you would not want a stranger doing — hashing a
password, minting an account number, spending money on a model call. On `127.0.0.1` the
socket is the protection. Anywhere else, ask the caller to sign.

A config adds [`secret=`](../generators/http.md#proving-the-request-came-from-tdc); the
request then carries two more headers, and the secret itself never travels:

```
X-TDC-Timestamp: 1786000000
X-TDC-Signature: hex(HMAC-SHA256(secret, timestamp \n seed \n count \n body))
```

Verifying is the same few lines in any language — recompute and compare:

```js
const mine = crypto
  .createHmac('sha256', process.env.TDC_HTTP_SECRET)
  .update(`${ts}\n${seed}\n${count}\n${body}`)
  .digest('hex');
if (mine !== req.headers['x-tdc-signature']) return res.status(401).end();
```

Three things worth knowing before you write that check:

- **The window is yours to choose.** TDC stamps its real clock and nothing else; how old a
  request may be before you refuse it is your policy. A few minutes is a sensible default,
  and it means clocks on the two machines have to roughly agree.
- **The secret does not expire**, so a suite that runs once a quarter still signs
  correctly. That is the reason for a signature rather than a token.
- **Signing is not encryption.** Over plain `http://` the body is still readable by anyone
  on the path. Use `https://` as well when the values themselves are sensitive.

## Before you point TDC at it

A short list, each item learned from the way this generator actually fails:

- **Answer with exactly `N` lines.** One too many or too few and the run stops with
  `returned N line(s) for a batch of M`. That check exists because a length mismatch
  means the answers no longer line up with the rows — silent corruption otherwise.
- **Keep the order.** Line _i_ of the response must answer line _i_ of the request. TDC
  can't detect a shuffle; you'd just get wrong data.
- **Values must not contain a newline**, in either direction — the protocol is
  line-delimited, so an embedded newline breaks the count. It fails loudly rather than
  corrupting anything, but it fails.
- **Be safe to call concurrently**, or run the generation with `--jobs 1`. TDC doesn't
  coordinate its workers for you.
- **Handle the whole batch in one request.** Don't fan out internally to one call per
  value; the batch is what keeps this fast.
- **Refuse before you work.** If you check a signature, check it first — a service that
  hashes a thousand passwords and then rejects the request has already spent the money.
