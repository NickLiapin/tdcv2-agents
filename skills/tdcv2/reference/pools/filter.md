# Narrowing with `filter`

Without `filter`, a row draws from the whole pool. With it, a row draws only from the
members the expression accepts.

The obvious case: a patient at the northern clinic must see a doctor who works there.

```xml
<tdc>
  <env count="10" seed="clinic" local="en">
    <pool name="Doctors" count="6">
      <sequence name="clinic"><gen type="text" value="North,South"/></sequence>
      <sequence name="name"><gen type="template" value="person.lastName"/></sequence>
    </pool>

    <sequence name="Clinic"><gen type="text" value="North,South" percent="50,50"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Patient"><gen type="template" value="person.female.firstName"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Seen"><gen type="pool" value="Doctors" filter="clinic == Clinic"/></sequence>
  </env>
  <block>
    <line><data>${{Clinic}} | ${{Patient}} -> Dr. ${{Seen.name}} (${{Seen.clinic}})</data></line>
  </block>
</tdc>
```

`./run clinic.tdc`

```
South | Barbara -> Dr. Smith (South)
North | Mary -> Dr. Jones (North)
South | Dorothy -> Dr. Garcia (South)
South | Jennifer -> Dr. Johnson (South)
North | Elizabeth -> Dr. Jones (North)
North | Patricia -> Dr. Jones (North)
North | Susan -> Dr. Williams (North)
South | Sarah -> Dr. Smith (South)
South | Margaret -> Dr. Garcia (South)
North | Linda -> Dr. Jones (North)
```

The clinic column and the doctor's clinic agree on every row.

## The draw stays uniform

`filter` decides **which members are on offer**, not which one is taken. Among the
members that pass, the pick is uniform — a northern patient can get any of the northern
doctors.

That is worth stating because the obvious alternative, "use the first member that
matches", would hand every northern patient the same doctor and quietly destroy the
spread the pool was built to have.

## What a name means inside `filter`

The expression is evaluated in **two scopes at once**: the candidate member's fields,
and the current row's columns.

| The name         | What it reads                                                         |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clinic`         | a **field** of the candidate member, if the pool has one by that name |
| `Clinic`         | a **column** of the current row                                       |
| `Doctors.clinic` | always the candidate's field — the qualified form                     |
| `North`          | a bare word, read as the literal string                               |

The order matters: a bare name is looked up as a member field **first**, and only then
as a row column. A name that is both is refused rather than guessed at:

`./run clinic.tdc`

```
error[TDC232]: "clinic" in filter= is both a field of pool "Doctors" and a sequence — which one is meant is not decidable
 --> clinic.tdc:8:27
  |
8 |     <sequence name="Seen"><gen type="pool" value="Doctors" filter="clinic == clinic"/></sequence>
  |                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |
note: Rename one of them. Qualifying one side ("Doctors.clinic") does not help: the other "clinic" still reads as the member's field, so the test would compare a value with itself.
```

A qualified name that the pool has not got is caught too:

`./run clinic.tdc`

```
error[TDC226]: filter= reads "Doctors.branch", but pool "Doctors" has no field "branch"
 --> clinic.tdc:7:27
  |
7 |     <sequence name="Seen"><gen type="pool" value="Doctors" filter="Doctors.branch == Site"/></sequence>
  |                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |
note: Fields of "Doctors": clinic.
```

An **unqualified** unknown name is left alone, on purpose: the expression language reads
a bare word as a string literal, which is how `filter="clinic == North"` says "northern
doctors only" without declaring anything.

## It is a full expression

`field == Column` is the common shape, but `filter` takes anything the
[expression language](../constructs/conditional-output.md#comparison-operators)
understands: `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `&&`, `||`, `!`, and arithmetic.

Comparison inside a filter follows the same rules as everywhere else, so a member holding
`01` is found by a row producing `1` — see [Comparison and truth](../reference/comparison.md).

That opens up the cases worth more than the clinic — a customer buying something they
can afford:

```xml
<tdc>
  <env count="8" seed="shop" local="en">
    <pool name="Catalog" count="6">
      <sequence name="item" uniq="true"><gen type="text" value="Kettle,Lamp,Chair,Desk,Rug,Clock"/></sequence>
      <sequence name="price"><gen type="number" value="10..300"/></sequence>
    </pool>

    <sequence name="Budget"><gen type="number" value="50..250"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Buys"><gen type="pool" value="Catalog" filter="price <= Budget"/></sequence>
  </env>
  <block>
    <line><data>budget ${{Budget}} -> ${{Buys.item}} at ${{Buys.price}}</data></line>
  </block>
</tdc>
```

`./run shop.tdc`

```
budget 232 -> Clock at 11
budget 124 -> Desk at 92
budget 61 -> Clock at 11
budget 148 -> Clock at 11
budget 208 -> Rug at 198
budget 54 -> Clock at 11
budget 102 -> Desk at 92
budget 60 -> Clock at 11
```

Nobody buys above their budget, and nothing had to be listed by hand.

> [!WARNING]
> **Write `<=` and `&&` directly**
>
> TDC does not expand XML entities. `filter="price &lt;= Budget"` reaches the parser as
> those nine characters and fails. Type the operator you mean.

### What it costs

Two paths, and which one runs is decided by how the filter is written:

| The filter                           | How a row is answered                                               |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `field == Column` (either way round) | the pool is bucketed by that field **once**; a row costs one lookup |
| anything else                        | the candidates are scanned, per row — linear in the pool size       |

Both are correct. The difference is why a pool has a
[size ceiling](overview.md#size) at all: a scan over a million members, two thousand
times, is a real cost, and the ceiling is where the tool says so.

## `filter` is not `if`, and `if` is not available here

Elsewhere `if` narrows by asking about the **row**, once per row. `filter` asks about
each **candidate**, once per member — thirty questions per row for a pool of thirty.

On a pool reference only `filter` exists. `if` is [refused](../reference/errors.md),
because a reference publishes a whole MEMBER rather than a value: a conditional one
would register no `Ref.field` columns at all, and `${{Doctor.name}}` would reach the
output as its own literal text.

To leave some rows without a member, use `parent`. It masks the reference exactly as it
masks any other sequence, and the fields come out empty on the rows it excludes:

```xml
<sequence name="Adult"><gen type="text" value="yes" if="Age >= 18"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Seen" parent="Adult"><gen type="pool" value="Doctors" filter="clinic == Clinic"/></sequence>
```

## When nobody matches

Because `filter` never produces an empty cell, "nobody matched" is an error rather than
a gap. The message names the row and the value that narrowed it to nothing:

`./run clinic.tdc`

```
tdcv2: pool "Doctors": no member satisfies filter="clinic == Clinic" for row 3 (Clinic="South"). A filter narrows the members a row may draw from; when it narrows them to none there is nothing to substitute. Add a member that matches, or widen the filter.
```

This particular one is a **run-time** refusal, because the validator cannot know that no
member will come out `South` until the pool has been drawn. Where the contradiction IS
provable from the config — both sides drawn from written lists that do not meet — `check`
refuses it before the run, without guessing, as [`TDC225`](../reference/errors.md). The
line between the two is what each side can be proven from, not when the failure happens to
show up. The two fixes are in the message — add a member that matches, or widen the
filter — and there is a third worth knowing: give the pool's field the same finite list
the row's column draws from, so every value is represented.
