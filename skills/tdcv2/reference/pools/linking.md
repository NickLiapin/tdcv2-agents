# Linking pools together

One pool gives a row a coherent record. Several pools give a row a coherent **world**:
clinics that exist, doctors who work at one of them, nurses who work alongside those
doctors. This page is about how the pieces connect.

There are exactly two ways to link, and they answer different questions:

| The link                     | Where it is fixed                                                   | Write it as                                |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------- |
| **A pool draws from a pool** | per member — this doctor works at that clinic, always               | `<gen type="pool">` inside a `<pool>`      |
| **A row's references agree** | per row — this patient's nurse is at this patient's doctor's clinic | `filter=` naming another reference's field |

The first builds the world. The second holds one row together.

## A pool that draws from a pool

A member of one pool can hold a whole member of another. Doctors belong to clinics:

```xml
<tdc>
  <env count="8" seed="probe" local="en">
    <pool name="Clinics" count="3">
      <sequence name="city" uniq="true"><gen type="text" value="North,South,East"/></sequence>
      <sequence name="phone"><gen type="number" value="100..999"/></sequence>
    </pool>

    <pool name="Doctors" count="5">
      <sequence name="name"><gen type="template" value="person.lastName"/></sequence>
      <sequence name="at"><gen type="pool" value="Clinics"/></sequence>
    </pool>

    <sequence name="Seen"><gen type="pool" value="Doctors"/></sequence>
  </env>
  <block>
    <line><data>Dr. ${{Seen.name}} @ ${{Seen.at.city}} (tel ${{Seen.at.phone}})</data></line>
  </block>
</tdc>
```

`./run clinics.tdc`

```
Dr. Johnson @ North (tel 825)
Dr. Johnson @ North (tel 825)
Dr. Williams @ East (tel 997)
Dr. Brown @ South (tel 415)
Dr. Brown @ South (tel 415)
Dr. Williams @ East (tel 997)
Dr. Smith @ East (tel 997)
Dr. Williams @ East (tel 997)
```

Three facts to read off that output:

- **The dot goes one level deeper.** `at` names a whole clinic, so it has no value of
  its own; its fields are `${{Seen.at.city}}` and `${{Seen.at.phone}}`. Writing
  `${{Seen.at}}` is refused for the same reason `${{Seen}}` is.
- **The link is fixed per member, not per row.** Dr. Jones is at the East clinic on
  every row where he appears, because the clinic was decided when the _doctor_ was
  built.
- **The clinic's own fields travel together.** East is always 300 — the phone belongs to
  the clinic record, not to the row.

### The order rule

A pool may only draw from a pool **declared above it**. Pools are built in the order
they are written, so a pool named below has no table yet when this one is computed:

`./run clinics.tdc`

```
error[TDC236]: pool "Doctors" draws from "Clinics", which is not declared above it
 --> clinics.tdc:5:7
  |
5 |       <sequence name="at"><gen type="pool" value="Clinics"/></sequence>
  |       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |
note: Pools are built in declaration order, so a pool can only read the pools above it. Move "Clinics" above "Doctors". That order is also why a cycle between pools cannot be written down.
```

That rule does a second job for free: **a cycle between pools cannot be written down.**
There is no cycle detection anywhere in TDC, because there is nothing to detect —
`Doctors` reaching `Clinics` is a table lookup, and `Clinics` reaching `Doctors` is a
name that does not exist yet. A pool naming itself gets the same code, for the same
reason.

### How deep can it go

As deep as you write it. Each level is an ordinary pool that happens to hold a reference,
so `${{Seen.at.region.name}}` is not a special case — it is three tables and two links.

The cost stays where you would want it: every pool is built once, before the run, so a
chain three deep is three small tables and no per-row work beyond the picks.

## Two references that agree

The second kind of link is between two references **in the same row**. A `filter` reads
the current row's columns, and a reference's fields are columns like any other — so a
nurse can be filtered to the clinic the row's doctor works at:

```xml
<tdc>
  <env count="8" seed="clinic" local="en">
    <pool name="Clinics" count="3">
      <sequence name="city" uniq="true"><gen type="text" value="North,South,East"/></sequence>
    </pool>
    <pool name="Doctors" count="6">
      <sequence name="name"><gen type="template" value="person.lastName"/></sequence>
      <sequence name="at"><gen type="pool" value="Clinics"/></sequence>
    </pool>
    <pool name="Nurses" count="9">
      <sequence name="name"><gen type="template" value="person.female.firstName"/></sequence>
      <sequence name="city"><gen type="text" value="North,South,East"/></sequence>
    </pool>

    <sequence name="Seen"><gen type="pool" value="Doctors"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Assisted"><gen type="pool" value="Nurses" filter="city == Seen.at.city"/></sequence>
  </env>
  <block>
    <line><data>Dr. ${{Seen.name}} (${{Seen.at.city}}) + nurse ${{Assisted.name}} (${{Assisted.city}})</data></line>
  </block>
</tdc>
```

`./run team.tdc`

```
Dr. Smith (South) + nurse Margaret (South)
Dr. Garcia (East) + nurse Linda (East)
Dr. Williams (South) + nurse Margaret (South)
Dr. Brown (North) + nurse Dorothy (North)
Dr. Garcia (East) + nurse Linda (East)
Dr. Garcia (East) + nurse Linda (East)
Dr. Jones (East) + nurse Jennifer (East)
Dr. Smith (South) + nurse Susan (South)
```

The filter reaches through two links in one expression: `Seen.at.city` is the row's
doctor's clinic's city. Nothing special makes that work — `Seen.at.city` is a column of
the row by the time `Assisted` is built, because references resolve in **declaration
order**, exactly as sequences do.

Declaring the reference you filter on **above** the one that filters is the habit to keep
— it reads in the order it happens. It is not, however, a requirement the engine enforces:
swapping `Seen` and `Assisted` in this example produces identical output and passes
`check`, because the pool TABLES are built before any row is drawn, so the filter finds
what it needs whichever line it sits on.

## A worked example

Three layers, four kinds of link, one config. Clinics exist; doctors belong to a clinic
and have a specialty in a fixed proportion; a patient needs a specialty and is seen by a
doctor who has it.

```xml
<tdc>
  <env count="10" seed="clinic" local="en">
    <pool name="Clinics" count="3">
      <sequence name="city" uniq="true"><gen type="text" value="North,South,East"/></sequence>
      <sequence name="phone"><gen type="number" value="200..299"/></sequence>
    </pool>

    <pool name="Doctors" count="8">
      <sequence name="name"><gen type="template" value="person.lastName"/></sequence>
      <mix name="role" percent="25,75">
        <case><gen type="text" value="surgeon"/></case>
        <case><gen type="text" value="therapist"/></case>
      </mix>
      <sequence name="at"><gen type="pool" value="Clinics"/></sequence>
    </pool>

    <sequence name="Patient"><gen type="template" value="person.female.firstName"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Needs"><gen type="text" value="surgeon,therapist" percent="30,70"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Seen"><gen type="pool" value="Doctors" filter="role == Needs"/></sequence>
  </env>
  <block>
    <line><data>${{Patient}} needs a ${{Needs}} -> Dr. ${{Seen.name}}, ${{Seen.at.city}} clinic, tel ${{Seen.at.phone}}</data></line>
  </block>
</tdc>
```

`./run clinic.tdc`

```
Barbara needs a therapist -> Dr. Jones, South clinic, tel 233
Mary needs a therapist -> Dr. Garcia, East clinic, tel 255
Dorothy needs a therapist -> Dr. Davis, South clinic, tel 233
Jennifer needs a therapist -> Dr. Brown, North clinic, tel 233
Elizabeth needs a surgeon -> Dr. Williams, South clinic, tel 233
Patricia needs a surgeon -> Dr. Williams, South clinic, tel 233
Susan needs a therapist -> Dr. Miller, East clinic, tel 255
Sarah needs a surgeon -> Dr. Williams, South clinic, tel 233
Margaret needs a therapist -> Dr. Davis, South clinic, tel 233
Linda needs a therapist -> Dr. Brown, North clinic, tel 233
```

Every constraint in that config holds in every row, and none of them was written twice:

- Two of the eight doctors are surgeons, because `percent="25,75"` applies to the
  **members**.
- Thirty percent of the patients need a surgeon, because `percent="30,70"` applies to
  the **rows**. Those are different populations and both are exact.
- A patient who needs a surgeon gets one, because `filter="role == Needs"` narrows the
  candidates.
- The phone number always belongs to the named city, because the clinic is a record the
  doctor holds.

Add a fourth layer — a region each clinic belongs to — and nothing about the config's
shape changes. That is the point of the construct.

## What is not supported

- **A `<pool>` inside a `<pool>`.** Refused (`TDC230`). A pool stays a flat table you
  could print; nesting would make it a tree, and every later question — uniqueness,
  filtering, the memory ceiling — would have to ask "at which depth?". Point one pool at
  another instead, which is what this page is about.
- **A pool drawing from a pool below it, or from itself.** Refused (`TDC236`), as above.
- **Weights on members.** A pool has no per-member weight. Use a
  [`<mix>`](../constructs/mix.md) inside the pool — that is the same thing said in the
  language the pool already speaks, and it is exact rather than approximate.
- **A reference with `parent=` on a streaming engine.** Not refused: the config is
  routed to the in-memory engine, which needs the whole parent column to know which rows
  exist at all.
