# Pools — a row that references a whole record

A [generator](../generators/overview.md) produces a value. A
[sequence](../core-concepts/sequences.md) is a column of those values. That covers most
of what a config needs — and then it runs into a wall.

Two thousand patients are seen by thirty doctors. Each patient row needs the doctor's
first name, last name, and room number. Three sequences side by side give you three
independent draws, so a row ends up with one doctor's first name next to another
doctor's room. The data looks plausible and is nonsense: `Dr. John Williams, room 118`
where no such doctor exists.

The missing idea is that **a doctor is not a value, he is a record** — and thirty of
them exist before the first patient does. `<pool>` is that table.

```xml
<tdc>
  <env count="8" seed="clinic" local="en">
    <pool name="Doctors" count="4">
      <sequence name="firstName"><gen type="template" value="person.male.firstName"/></sequence>
      <sequence name="lastName"><gen type="template" value="person.lastName"/></sequence>
      <sequence name="room"><gen type="number" value="100..199"/></sequence>
    </pool>

    <sequence name="Patient"><gen type="template" value="person.female.firstName"/></sequence>
    <sequence name="Seen"><gen type="pool" value="Doctors"/></sequence>
  </env>
  <block>
    <line><data>${{Patient}} -> Dr. ${{Seen.firstName}} ${{Seen.lastName}}, room ${{Seen.room}}</data></line>
  </block>
</tdc>
```

`./run clinic.tdc`

```
Barbara -> Dr. James Johnson, room 100
Mary -> Dr. Michael Smith, room 186
Margaret -> Dr. Robert Brown, room 148
Jennifer -> Dr. John Williams, room 154
Elizabeth -> Dr. Michael Smith, room 186
Patricia -> Dr. Michael Smith, room 186
Susan -> Dr. John Williams, room 154
Linda -> Dr. James Johnson, room 100
```

Four doctors serve eight patients, and each doctor's three fields stay glued together.
James Smith is in room 197 on every row where he appears, because the row picked
**Smith** — not "a first name, a last name, and a room".

*Four members, eight rows. Every row takes one whole line of the table.*

- **A** — the pool: four members, built once before the run
- **B** — the generated rows
- **C** — one pick per row — both cells of a row always come from the same member

## Two things happen, in this order

1. **The pool is built.** Before any row exists, TDC materializes `count` members. This
   happens once, whether the run is 8 rows or 8 billion.
2. **Each row draws one member.** A `<gen type="pool">` gives its sequence one whole
   member per row, and publishes every field of that member under `Ref.field`.

Everything else on this page follows from those two sentences.

## At a glance

`<pool>` lives **directly in [`<env>`](../core-concepts/configuration.md)**, beside
`<sequence>`. It is never read directly; a sequence draws from it.

| On `<pool>` | Required | What it does                                    |
| :---------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| `name`      | yes      | The name a `<gen type="pool">` names in `value` |
| `count`     | yes      | How many members the table holds                |
| `comment`   | no       | Free-text note                                  |

| On `<gen type="pool">` | Required | What it does                                                                     |
| :--------------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `value`                | yes      | The pool to draw from                                                            |
| `filter`               | no       | Which members this row may draw from — [Narrowing](filter.md)                   |
| `parent`               | no       | Leave some rows without a member at all — [Narrowing](filter.md#filter-is-not-if-and-if-is-not-available-here) |

## A pool is a miniature `<env>`

This is the design decision worth knowing, because it answers most questions before you
ask them. A pool's body is built by the same machinery a config's `<env>` is built by,
with the **member count** standing in for the row count.

So everything you already know still applies inside a pool:

| Inside a pool                                               | Means                                                 |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `<sequence>`                                                | a field of each member                                |
| [`<mix>`](../constructs/mix.md)                            | a field split by exact `percent` — across the MEMBERS |
| [`<switch>`](../constructs/switch.md)                      | a field derived from another field of the same member |
| [`<uniq>`](../constructs/unique-values.md) · `uniq="true"` | members that must differ from one another             |
| `<distinct>`                                                | two fields of one member that must differ             |
| `if=`                                                       | a field only some members have                        |
| `parent=`                                                   | a field built over the members another field selected |
| `<compute>`                                                 | a field calculated from the member's other fields     |

What a pool may **not** hold is output: no `<block>`, and no fixture tags. A pool is a
table other columns read, not something written to a file. It also may not contain
another `<pool>` — pools stay flat tables, and one
[points at another](linking.md) instead of nesting.

## Two names, one dot

The pool has a `name`; so does the sequence that draws from it. They are different
things:

```xml
<pool name="Doctors" count="4"> … </pool>

<sequence name="Seen"><gen type="pool" value="Doctors"/></sequence>
```

- `Doctors` is the **table**. Nothing in `<block>` refers to it.
- `Seen` is the **column** that holds one doctor per row. You read its fields as
  `${{Seen.firstName}}`.

Two sequences may draw from the same pool, and they pick independently — `Seen` and
`Referred` would be two different doctors on the same row, which is usually the point.

Reading the reference without a field is refused, because there is nothing to print:

`./run clinic.tdc`

```
error[TDC229]: "Seen" draws a whole member from a pool — it has no value of its own to print
 --> clinic.tdc:8:16
  |
8 |   <block><line><data>${{Seen}}</data></line></block>
  |                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |
note: Read a field: ${{Seen.name}}.
```

## One pick per row

A sequence holds one value per row. A pool reference is a sequence, so it holds **one
member** per row — and every `${{Seen.…}}` in that row reads the same one.

That single rule is what the construct is for. It is also why "Dmitry Ivanova" — a male
first name with a female surname — is not something a pool can produce: the gender, the
first name, and the last name are fields of one member, and a row that took the member
took all three.

The pick is **uniform over the members** — a draw, not a rota, because nobody declared a
proportion; see [declared shares or a draw](../generators/overview.md#declared-shares-or-a-draw-from-a-source).
It is also [seekable](../core-concepts/determinism.md):
row 900,000,000 finds its doctor without the 899,999,999 rows before it ever existing.
That is why a pool costs the same on every engine.

## Proportions inside the pool

Because the pool is built by the ordinary machinery, `percent` works inside it exactly
as it does at the top level. Thirty percent of the doctors are surgeons:

```xml
<pool name="Doctors" count="10">
  <mix name="role" percent="30,70">
    <case><gen type="text" value="surgeon"/></case>
    <case><gen type="text" value="therapist"/></case>
  </mix>
  <sequence name="name"><gen type="template" value="person.lastName"/></sequence>
</pool>
```

The share applies to the **ten members**, not to the rows. Three doctors are surgeons;
how often those three are seen depends on how the rows draw — and on
[`filter`](filter.md), which is what turns "three of the doctors are surgeons" into
"patients who need a surgeon get one".

## Members that differ from one another

`uniq` inside a pool means what it means outside: no two members share the value.

```xml
<pool name="Rooms" count="6">
  <sequence name="number" uniq="true"><gen type="number" value="100..199"/></sequence>
</pool>
```

Six distinct room numbers, drawn without replacement. A pool whose members are meant to
be _different things_ usually wants this on at least one field — otherwise two members
can come out identical, and a row cannot tell them apart.

## The pool's own seed

A pool is **not** drawn from the run's main stream. It derives a seed of its own:

```
<the run's seed> + "#pool:" + <the pool's name>
```

A pool named `Doctors` in a run seeded `main` is built from `main#pool:Doctors`. There is
no `seed` attribute on `<pool>` — the derivation is the whole mechanism, and writing one
is reported (`TDC015`).

**Why it is derived rather than taken.** If the pool drew from the main stream, adding one
to a config would shift **every column declared below it**: the ids would stay and the
ages, names and dates would all move, and yesterday's snapshot would stop matching for a
reason invisible in the diff. A derived seed makes a pool invisible to everything it does
not feed.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- Change the run's `seed` and the pool changes with it. That is the point — one number
  still reproduces the whole run.
- **Renaming a pool changes its members**, because the name is part of the derived seed.
  Renaming is not cosmetic; if the exact members matter, leave the name alone.

## Size

A pool is held in memory for the whole run — that is what makes a row's lookup free.
Measured on the reference implementation, a member with four fields costs about
320 bytes.

| Members        | Roughly      | What happens        |
| :------------- | :----------- | :------------------ |
| up to 100,000  | up to ~29 MB | nothing; it runs    |
| over 100,000   |              | `TDC234`, a warning |
| over 1,000,000 | over ~290 MB | `TDC235`, refused   |

Both messages end the same way, because it is the usual cause: if you meant the number
of **rows**, that is `count` on `<env>`.

The ceiling is about the table, not the run. A pool of thirty doctors serves a billion
patient rows at the same cost as a thousand, and works on every
[engine](../guides/large-outputs.md).

## Where to go next

- [Narrowing with `filter`](filter.md) — which members a row may draw from, and how
  that differs from `if`
- [Linking pools together](linking.md) — several pools, a pool that draws from a pool,
  and chains that run three deep
