# Error codes

Every diagnostic TDC can raise, listed by code. Look one up when a run stops and the
message alone isn't enough.

## How to read a diagnostic

A diagnostic carries four things. The code is the part that never changes between
versions — the wording may improve, but `TDC193` stays `TDC193`:

`./run demo.tdc`

```
error[TDC193]: "Naem" is not a declared sequence — it would be printed literally
 --> demo.tdc:8:11
  |
8 |     <line><data>${{Naem}}</data></line>
  |           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |
help: did you mean "Name"?
note: Declare it in <env>, or set a different inject= pattern if you really want the text ${{…}} in the output.
```

- the **code** — what went wrong, stable across releases;
- the **place** — file, line, and column, with the offending element underlined;
- **`help:`** — a guess at what you meant, when the name is a near miss;
- **`note:`** — what to do about it.

Validation runs before generation, so a config with errors produces no data at all rather
than half a file. Almost every diagnostic here is an **error** and stops the run: if the
config asked for something it wouldn't actually get, TDC refuses rather than handing back
data that looks right but isn't. The exceptions are twelve **warnings** that let the run finish: `TDC136` (a malformed
`<map>` row is skipped and the valid rows still apply), `TDC171` (a pack file whose header
puts it at no address), `TDC200` (a memory estimate that is large but still fits),
`TDC216` (an expression that is always true or always false), `TDC221` (a `<uniq>` or
`<distinct>` group with one member, which constrains nothing), `TDC231` (a `<pool>` nothing
reads), `TDC234` (a pool over
100,000 members), `TDC299` (a `uniq` column past 100,000 rows, whose memory
follows the row count — its second meaning, a pool declared out of order, is an error) `TDC251` (a `percent` share
that asks for less than one row), `TDC272` (a locale that is a fine source of names and
ships no month names, so the dates come out English) and `TDC284` (a `secret=` written into
the config as a literal — a key travels wherever the config does) and `TDC301` (a share list
that leaves a declared value at 0%, so it can never be drawn). Each says
as much in its row below.

The numbers run roughly in the order a config is checked — structure first, then
generators, then everything built on top of them — but a number is an identifier, not a
classification. Use the groups below.

## Document structure

| Code     | Fires when                                                        | Fix                                                                                                                                    |
| :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TDC001` | The file has no `<tdc>` root, **or** it could not be parsed at all — a syntax error, including a closing tag that names another element (`<sequence>…</gen>`) or elements nested deeper than **64 levels**, which no real config reaches and a generated one does | Wrap everything in a single `<tdc>…</tdc>`, or fix the syntax the message points at. Nothing else is checked until the file parses      |
| `TDC002` | `<tdc>` has no `<block>` child                                    | Add the `<block>` that describes one record's layout                                                                                   |
| `TDC003` | Both `version` and `v` are given on `<tdc>`                       | Keep one — they're aliases                                                                                                             |
| `TDC004` | The declared document version isn't a valid version number        | Use a version this runtime supports, e.g. `v="0.1"` (a value newer than the runtime raises `TDC005`)                                   |
| `TDC005` | The file asks for a version newer than this runtime               | Upgrade TDC, or lower the declared version                                                                                             |
| `TDC010` | A tag other than `<env>` or `<block>` sits directly under `<tdc>` | Move it inside one of those two                                                                                                        |
| `TDC013` | A tag is nested somewhere it isn't allowed                        | See [Tags](tags.md) for what may contain what                                                                                         |
| `TDC014` | A tag that has to hold children is written self-closing           | Write `<env …></env>`, not `<env …/>` — its children would be silently dropped                                                         |
| `TDC015` | A tag carries an attribute the engine doesn't read                | The run stops, because the config asked for something it wouldn't get. Check the spelling — the message suggests the nearest real name |
| `TDC020` | `count` isn't a non-negative integer                              | `count="1000"`                                                                                                                         |
| `TDC021` | An `inject` pattern with no hole, or with more than one           | A `%` is the hole only where it has text on BOTH sides, and a marker has exactly one — `inject="[[%]]"`. None (`"%%"`, `"%x"`, no `%` at all) and nothing is ever substituted; several (`"[%]-[%]"`) and only the rightmost is read, the others turning into literal `%` your text does not contain. `inject="%{%}%"` is legal: only its middle `%` qualifies |

| Code     | Fires when                                                              | Fix                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `TDC222` | A `<pool>` with no `name`, or with no `count`                           | A pool is read by name and holds a fixed number of members: `<pool name="Doctors" count="30">`                                                                                                                                                            |
| `TDC223` | A `<pool count="…">` that is not a whole number of at least 1           | A pool of nothing has no member to hand out                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `TDC224` | `<gen type="pool" value="X">` where no `<pool name="X">` is declared    | The message lists the declared pools. Declare it in the same `<env>`                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `TDC225` | `filter="field == X"` where the two sides can never hold a common value | Both lists are written in the config, and they do not meet — so every row is narrowed to no member at all. The message names both. Only a certain contradiction is reported here; a value that merely comes up rarely is refused at the row that draws it |
| `TDC226` | `filter=` reads `Pool.field` and the pool has no such field             | The message lists the pool's fields. An **unqualified** unknown name is left alone — the expression language reads a bare word as a literal                                                                                                               |
| `TDC229` | `${{Ref}}` where `Ref` draws a whole member                             | A member is a record, not a value. Read a field: `${{Ref.lastName}}`                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `TDC230` | A `<block>`, a fixture tag, or another `<pool>` inside a `<pool>`       | A pool is a table other columns read, not something written to a file, and pools do not nest                                                                                                                                                              |
| `TDC231` | _(warning)_ A `<pool>` no `<gen type="pool">` reads                     | It is built in full before the first row and kept in memory for the whole run, so an unread one is paid for and thrown away. Read it, or remove it                                                                                                        |
| `TDC232` | A name in `filter=` that is both a field of the pool and a sequence     | Rename one of them. Qualifying one side does not help — the other name still reads as the member's field, so the test compares a value with itself                                                                                                        |
| `TDC234` | _(warning)_ Over 100,000 members                                        | A pool stays in memory for the whole run — about 320 bytes a member with four fields. If you meant the number of ROWS, that is `count` on `<env>`                                                                                                         |
| `TDC235` | Over 1,000,000 members                                                  | Same cause, past the point where it is worth running. Reduce the pool, or move the number to `<env count="…">`                                                                                                                                            |
| `TDC236` | A pool reads a pool declared below it, or itself                        | Pools are built in declaration order, so a pool can only read the pools above it. Move the one it reads up. That order is also why a cycle between pools cannot be written down                                                                           |
| `TDC241` | Two pools declared under one name                                       | A pool is reached by name, so two cannot share one. The second used to replace the first in silence, and the only sign was a `TDC193` in the block about a field that "does not exist"                                                                    |

Three numbers in this range were reserved while pools were being designed and will
stay unused, so the gaps are declared rather than silent:

- **`TDC227`** — `filter=` naming a column that does not exist. A bare word in the
  expression language has always been a string literal, and that is what
  `filter="clinic == North"` uses to say "northern only". A typo and a literal are
  the same thing written down, so the check would put an error on working configs.
  Where the literal is a certain mistake — no member could ever hold that value —
  `TDC225` says so instead, without guessing.
- **`TDC228`** — `${{Pool.field}}` addressing a pool without going through a
  reference. `TDC193` already reports it as a name that resolves to nothing, and a
  second code for the same sentence is not worth the number.
- **`TDC233`** — no candidate passed `filter=` on row N, for expressions richer
  than a simple equality. That refusal happens and is worth having; it just is not
  a diagnostic code. It compares against a value that only exists once the row is
  being built, so it belongs to the run, and the run's message names the row and
  the value that matched nobody.

## Running totals

See [`accumulate=`](../constructs/multiple-values.md#accumulate--a-running-total-across-the-list)
and [`<gen type="running">`](../generators/running.md).

| Code     | Fires when                                                                            | Fix                                                                                                                                  |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TDC237` | `accumulate=` on a generator with no `repeat=`                                        | There is no list to accumulate. Add `repeat="N"`, or drop `accumulate=`. (`type="running"` is exempt — it accumulates down a column) |
| `TDC238` | `accumulate=` names an operation that does not exist                                  | One of `sum`, `min`, `max`                                                                                                           |
| `TDC239` | `<gen type="running">` does not say what (`of=`) or how (`accumulate=`) to accumulate | A running total reads another column and draws nothing of its own, so both are required                                              |
| `TDC240` | `of=` or `reset=` names a column not declared above                                   | The total is built from a column that already exists — the same rule `parent=` follows                                               |

## `<compute>`

| Code     | Fires when                                                                                                | Fix                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `TDC180` | A tag inside `<compute>` that the compute language does not have; a predicate written outside `<test>`; a `<let>` where a value is read; `<data>` or `<map>` inside `<compute>` | The message names the tag. Check it against the [compute reference](../compute/overview.md) — a predicate such as `<eq>` is valid only inside `<test>`, a `<let>` only ahead of the value in a slot, and a literal is `<str v="…"/>`, never raw text |
| `TDC181` | A tag outside the construct that reads it: `<current>`, `<current_index>` or `<acc>` outside its iteration body, `<over>` outside `<each>`/`<reduce>`, `<when>` outside `<choose>`, `<test>` outside `<when>` | They exist only inside their owner — `<current>` in a `<do>`, `<when>` in a `<choose>`. Outside it the run would stop on them |
| `TDC182` | `<use name="X">` names no enclosing `<let>`                                                               | Wrap it in `<let name="X">…</let>`, or fix the name                                                                                                     |
| `TDC183` | A compute op that takes a fixed number of operands got another number | Only `<divide>` and `<mod>` are binary, and `<is_digit>` takes exactly one — a second was never looked at. `<add>`, `<subtract>` and `<multiply>` are variadic: `<add>` over three operands sums all three, and over none it is `0` (`<multiply>` is `1`) |
| `TDC184` | `<choose>` has no `<otherwise>` branch                                                                    | Add `<otherwise>` — every record needs an answer                                                                                                        |
| `TDC185` | A `<let name="X">` shadows an outer binding of the same name                                              | Rename one — the inner binding would hide the outer one                                                                                                 |
| `TDC186` | `<encode>`: unknown encoding                                                                              | One of: `base36`, `ascii`, `unicode`, `hex`, `binary`, `octal`                                                                                          |
| `TDC187` | A construct is missing a part it needs: a wrapper child, a predicate in `<test>`, or the value of a slot | `<when>` wants `<test>`, `<each>` wants `<over>` — the message names the pair. A slot such as `<result>`, `<upper>` or `<let>` needs one value inside it; empty, the run would stop on the first row |
| `TDC188` | `<int v="…">` isn't a whole number                                                                        | Write a whole number; for text, use `<str v="…"/>`                                                                                                      |
| `TDC189` | A part of `<compute>` that would be computed and thrown away: a second `<result>`, a sibling beside `<result>`, `<list>` with both `v=` and children, a second value in a slot, a second predicate in `<test>` | A slot holds one value and keeps the LAST, so `<result><str v="a"/><str v="b"/></result>` printed `b` without a word; `<test>` asks its FIRST predicate only. Keep one — name the others with `<let>`, join them with `<concat>`, or nest a second `<choose>` |

## `<mix>`, `<switch>`, fixtures

| Code     | Fires when                                                                                                 | Fix                                                         |
| :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TDC120` | `<mix>` has no `<case>`                                                                                    | A mix needs branches to pick between                        |
| `TDC121` | A `percent` on a `<mix>`/`<switch>` has more entries than there are cases                                  | One percentage per case                                     |
| `TDC122` | A `percent` entry on a `<mix>`/`<switch>` isn't a non-negative number                                      | Every filled position has to be a number                    |
| `TDC123` | The `percent` values on a `<mix>`/`<switch>` don't add up to 100                                           | Adjust them to total 100                                    |
| `TDC124` | `<mix>` has a child that isn't a `<case>`                                                                  | Only `<case>` belongs there                                 |
| `TDC125` | `<case>` has an unknown child                                                                              | Allowed: `<data>`, `<gen>`, `<mix>`, `<switch>` — a nested `<switch>` inside a branch is a first-class construct (see TDC245) |
| `TDC131` | A fixture holds a tag it does not accept, or a `<data>` with no `<line>` around it                          | A fixture body is made of `<line>`s. A bare `<data>` used to validate and render nothing at all |
| `TDC132` | A tag that doesn't belong there sits inside `<line>`                                                       | The output block is for layout — generators live in `<env>` |
| `TDC133` | `<switch>` has no `on`                                                                                     | Name the sequence being switched on                         |
| `TDC134` | `on` names a sequence, or a field of one, that doesn't exist                                               | Check the name — the message says which half is wrong       |
| `TDC135` | `<switch>` has no entries                                                                                  | Add a `<map>`, `<case>`, or `<default>`                     |
| `TDC136` | _(warning)_ A `<map>` row isn't `KEY:VALUE` — the bad row is skipped and the rest of the map still applies | One pair per entry, separated by a colon                    |
| `TDC137` | A `<case>` inside `<switch>` has no `is`                                                                   | `is` is the branch key                                      |
| `TDC245` | `name` on a `<switch>` written inside a `<case>` | The nested form contributes a value to that branch; only an env-level `<switch>` becomes a column |

## Dates

| Code     | Fires when                               | Fix                                                                 |

| `TDC150` | Only one of `from` / `to` is given       | Give both endpoints or neither                                      |
| `TDC151` | The date value doesn't parse             | `value="2020-01-01..2025-12-31"`, `"birth"`, `"today"`, `"now"`     |

## While rendering

These are raised during generation rather than validation — the config is well-formed,
but the combination it asks for can't be carried out.

| Code     | Fires when                                                                                      | Fix                                                                                     |

| `TDC161` | Weighted `advanced_regex` choices are used inline                                               | Exact percentages need the whole column — move it into a `<sequence>`                   |
| `TDC162` | An inline counter's `value` or `step` isn't numeric                                             | `value="1" step="2"`                                                                    |

| `TDC171` | _(warning)_ A data-pack file lands at no address, so it is skipped                              | Add `address:` or `locale:` to its header, or move it under a locale folder             |

## Formatting and modifiers

| Code     | Fires when                                                       | Fix                                                                      |
| :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TDC190` | `case` isn't a known transform                                   | `upper`, `lower`, `capitalize`, `title`                                  |
| `TDC191` | `order` is neither `random` nor `sequential`                     | Those are the only two values                                            |
| `TDC192` | An interpolation filter is unknown                               | See [Masks & case](../guides/masks-and-case.md)                         |
| `TDC193` | `${{Name}}` or `${{Name.field}}` names nothing that was declared | It would print literally — the whole reference is checked, field and all |
| `TDC193` | _(second meaning)_ `anomaly_flag=` on a `<gen>` with no `anomaly=` | The flag column marks which rows were made outliers, and nothing made any. Add `anomaly="p"`, or drop the flag |
| `TDC194` | A typed `<data>` has no `name`                                   | Only a named `<data>` becomes a column                                   |
| `TDC195` | `repeat` isn't a count or a range                                | `repeat="3"` or `repeat="1..5"` (0 to 64)                                |
| `TDC196` | `repeat` is used on a `<mix>`                                    | A mix picks one branch; it doesn't produce a list                        |
| `TDC198` | `separator` without `repeat`                                     | It joins repeated values, so there have to be some                       |
| `TDC199` | A `mask` index is malformed                                      | Indices are 0-based and ranges use `..` — `x[0..3]`, `w[-1]`             |
| `TDC202` | `flag` is set but no `<case>` is marked `anomaly="true"`         | The column would be all-negative — mark the outlier branch               |
| `TDC203` | `flag` is used on a nested `<mix>`                               | Only a named env-level mix carries the answer column                     |
| `TDC204` | `repeat` is used on a generator that can't repeat                | The message names the type                                               |
| `TDC206` | `each=""` names no sequence                                      | Name the list to walk                                                    |
| `TDC207` | `each` names a single-value sequence                             | It has to be a list — add `repeat` to the source                         |
| `TDC209` | A named `<data>` sits inside an `each=` line                     | That line produces several rows, so a column name is ambiguous           |
| `TDC211` | `weight` is used on a generator other than `file`                | Weights come from a CSV column                                           |
| `TDC212` | `weight` without `column`                                        | The weights live in a second column, which has to be named               |
| `TDC213` | `weight` is combined with `order`                                | `order` walks the rows by position; weighting picks them by frequency    |
| `TDC242` | `anomaly` or `missing` isn't a number in `[0, 1]`                | Both are a SHARE of the values: `anomaly="0.05"`, `missing="0.1"`        |
| `TDC243` | `anomaly` on a `value` list with no number in it                 | An anomaly multiplies a number, so a list of words comes back unchanged  |
| `TDC246` | `anomaly_flag` on a `<gen>` inside a `<case>`                    | A case body is several parts joined, so a flag on one part doesn't describe the row — put `flag="NAME"` on the `<mix>` instead |
| `TDC247` | `step` on a `<gen type="date">` is not a step it can walk, or mixes a calendar unit with a fixed one | Write `15m`, `1h30m`, `2d`, `3mo`, `1y` — units `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`, `w`, `mo`, `y`; a bare number means days |
| `TDC248` | `step` without `order="sequential"` on the same `<gen>`            | Nothing walks the range — the dates are still drawn at random. Add `order="sequential"`, or drop `step` |
| `TDC249` | `weekdays` names a weekday that does not exist                    | sun, mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat — a span like `mon..fri` or a list like `sun,wed` |
| `TDC250` | `weekdays` with a step of a whole number of weeks, or a calendar step | Two reasons under one code. A whole number of weeks fixes the weekday, so the filter matches every row or none. A calendar step does the opposite — `1mo` walks Thursday, Sunday, Sunday, Wednesday — so which rows survive would follow the calendar rather than the config |
| `TDC252` | `peak_at` on a `<gen type="timeseries">` is not a number                     | `peak_at` is the row the seasonal wave peaks on, counted like `period` — `peak_at="182"` over `period="365"` puts the peak at the first of July |
| `TDC253` | `peak_at` with no `period` on the same `<gen>`                              | A wave needs a length before it can have a highest point. Add `period`, or remove `peak_at` |
| `TDC251` | _(warning)_ A `percent` share asks for less than one whole row              | `percent` is an exact quota over the rows that reach it, so 10% of a five-row subset asks for half a record. Half a record cannot be emitted: the branch fires once or not at all, and the seed decides which. Raise the share, or raise `count`
| `TDC254` | A walk that has no stride: a RANGED `repeat="2..5"` beside `order="sequential"`, or a walked `date` with any `repeat=` | A fixed `repeat="4"` works — the row takes four values off the walk. A ranged one has no fixed number of values per row, so row 5 would start wherever rows 0 to 4 happened to leave off. A walked date carries an instant beside its text, and a row holding several dates has no single one to give `of=` and `plus=` |
| `TDC255` | `decimals=` together with `include=` or `exclude=`                            | Drop one. A set built by `include`/`exclude` holds whole numbers and the pick is uniform over them, so there is nothing fractional to round — the engine was quietly emitting integers |
| `TDC256` | A mask with no pattern — `<mask>` without `pattern=`, or `${{X\|mask}}` with no argument | Give it a pattern. Without one the mask keeps nothing and returns the empty string, so the column comes out blank |
| `TDC257` | An `if=` expression calls a function that is not there | Either a typo, answered with the near name, or one of `sin`, `cos`, `exp`, `log` and their kin, answered with the reason: every host language computes those slightly differently, and a comparison turns the last bit into a different row. Available today: `abs`, `ceil`, `floor`, `max`, `min`, `round`, `trunc` |
| `TDC258` | A function in an `if=` expression is given the wrong number of arguments | `abs`, `ceil`, `floor`, `round` and `trunc` take exactly one; `min` and `max` take as many as you give them |
| `TDC259` | A `[list]` sits somewhere other than the right of `in` | A list is a set of values to test against, so it only means something as `Country in [US, CA, MX]`. On its own it has no value for the condition to be |
| `TDC260` | `at()` is given something that is not a list | A `repeat` list reaches an expression as its joined text, so `at(Items, 1)` asks for the second element of a one-element list and answers with nothing. Cut it first: `at(split(Items, ","), 1)` |
| `TDC261` | `at()` is given an index that is not one | An index is a whole number, zero or more. Past the end is empty text on purpose — rows made by `repeat="1..4"` have different lengths — but `-1`, `1.5` and `"one"` are mistakes, and each of them used to produce that same blank column |
| `TDC262` | `<gen type="stat">` does not say what (`of=`) or which statistic (`op=`), or names one that does not exist | A statistic reads another column and draws nothing of its own, so both are required. `op=` is one of `sum`, `mean`, `median`, `min`, `max`, `count`, `stddev`; `decimals=` is 0 to 10 |
| `TDC263` | `${{Name}}` in an attribute that does not expand it | Interpolation reaches the text inside `<data>` and `<gen type="template" value=>`, and nowhere else — anywhere else the braces are literal characters. To make one column depend on another, read it in an `if=` condition, or build the value in a `<compute>` sequence |
| `TDC264` | `<gen type="date" of="…">` is written wrong | An offset needs `plus=` (`7d`, `3..10d`, `1..3mo`, `-10..-3d`), written smallest bound first, in a unit `step=` also uses. The attributes that bound the generator's OWN draw — `value`, `from`, `to`, `range`, `oldest`, `youngest`, `order`, `step` — say nothing once `of=` has placed the date relative to another column, so they are refused rather than ignored. The mirror is refused too: `plus=` on a date with no `of=` has nothing to be far from |
| `TDC265` | `<assert>` has no condition | An assertion is the one construct whose whole worth is that it fails, and without `that=` it never can. Write the property the run must have, in the `if=` language, over whole-run columns |
| `TDC266` | `<assert>` has no message | `says=` is what a reader is told when it fires, months later, in a CI log. An expression on its own leaves them to work out what it was defending |
| `TDC267` | _(second meaning)_ `uniq="true"` on a `<sequence>` wrapping a `<distinct>` | `<distinct>` repairs one record so its fields differ; `uniq` then rearranges the finished columns and knows nothing about which pairings the repair ruled out, so it undoes them. Keep one — or give each field its own `<sequence>`, wrap those in `<uniq>`, and put the `<distinct>` at env level |
| `TDC267` | `uniq="true"` together with `mask=`, `case=`, `missing=`, `repeat=`, `separator=` or `anomaly=` | A draw without replacement produces the column directly and never reaches the layer that rewrites values, so the attribute could only ever be dropped. Applying it would break the other promise: a mask maps two distinct draws onto the same characters |
| `TDC268` | A `<gen type="pool">` anywhere but as a whole `<sequence>`: under `if=`, as the fallback branch, inside a `<case>`, as a part or a field | A reference publishes a whole MEMBER as `Ref.field` columns, and a branch or a part has no column of its own to publish them under — so `${{Ref.name}}` reached the output as its own literal text, or the run stopped after a clean `check`. Draw the member in a sequence of its own and read its fields where they are needed; use `parent=` to leave rows without a member |
| `TDC269` | `if=` on a `<gen>` inside a `<case>` | A case body is several parts joined into one value, so a condition on one part has no value to fall back to. It was accepted and ignored, and the part appeared on every row — including the ones the condition excluded. Put the condition on the branch: `<case if="…">` |
| `TDC270` | `<tdc>` holds a second `<env>` or `<block>` | Both are read by taking the FIRST of their kind, so a second one is discarded whole — every sequence it declares, every line it lays out — while the run finishes looking healthy. Reported on the second one |
| `TDC271` | `percent=` beside `order="sequential"` | Walking the list in order fixes which value each row gets, so there is no share left to apportion. The percentage was accepted and dropped: `percent="98,1,1"` over a hundred rows came out 34 / 33 / 33 |
| `TDC272` | _(warning)_ `<env local=…>` names a locale with no date translations | The locale is a fine source of NAMES and ships no month names, so the dates render in English. Refused outright on `<gen type="date" local=…>` (TDC153) and silent here until now. Fires only when the format reads the locale — `format="YYYY-MM-DD"` is the same in every language |
| `TDC273` | a filter argument the filter cannot use | `slice:5,2` ends before it starts and empties the column; `slice:abc`, `group:abc`, `group:0`, `compact:1` and `compact:99` leave the value untouched. `group` and `compact` with NO argument keep their documented defaults (3, base 36) |
| `TDC274` | an argument on a filter that reads none | `trim`, `sql`, `upper`, `lower`, `capitalize` and `title` are whole transforms; `${{X\|trim:junk}}` silently ignored the `junk`. Chain instead: `${{X\|trim\|upper}}` |
| `TDC275` | `replace` with nothing to look for | `${{X\|replace}}` and `${{X\|replace:,to}}` change nothing at all. Write both parts: `${{X\|replace:from,to}}` |
| `TDC276` | a pinned pack parameter of the wrong width | An identifier with a check digit has a fixed layout, so a wider or narrower part breaks it rather than shifting it. `usa.finance.aba_routing prefix="12345"` aborted the run; `tail="678"` wrote a six-digit non-number. Only reported where the width can be PROVEN from the pack's own body |
| `TDC277` | `decimals=` with no range to round | Without `value=` the generator produces a digit STRING — an identifier — so there is nothing to round. `<gen type="number" length="4" decimals="2"/>` emitted 4566, 5773, 5192 |
| `TDC278` | `decimals=` beside `length=` | A fractional value has no integer width to pad to, so `length=` was the one discarded: `value="1..9" length="3" decimals="2"` emitted 3.78, 2.89 |
| `TDC279` | `first_zero="false"` the range can never satisfy | Every draw from `0..5` is one digit, so a three-wide rendering always pads. The generator redrew a hundred times per row and emitted the forbidden shape anyway: 005, 002, 003. Only reported where the range PROVES it |
| `TDC280` | two spellings of the same date range | `value=`, the `from`/`to` pair and `range=` say one thing, and the generator reads them in that order and stops. `value="2020-05-05" from="1990-01-01" to="1990-12-31"` produced 1990-05-11 and discarded the rest without a word. `value="today"`, `"now"` and `"birth"` are spellings too |
| `TDC281` | a date range that ends before it starts | The draw took the min and max of the two ends, so `from="2020-01-01" to="2010-01-01"` produced perfectly plausible dates from a range nobody wrote. `plus="10..3d"` has been refused as a typo rather than swapped since it was written; this is the same typo |
| `TDC282` | `order="sequential"` on only some members of a `row=` link                                           | Either give every member of the link `order="sequential"`, or drop it — a mixed link stops reading one line per record                                                          |
| `TDC283` | `anomaly_flag` on a `<gen>` that is only one part of its `<sequence>` | The flag records which ROWS were made outliers, and a sequence built from several parts — a second `<gen>`, a `<data>` literal, or a `name=` that makes this gen a field — has no row-level column to put it in. Move the `<gen>` into a `<sequence>` of its own; that also gives you the value as its own column. The same reasoning as `TDC246`, one level out |
| `TDC284` | _(warning)_ `secret=` written into the config, or an empty one | A key in a config travels wherever the config does — into version control with it. `secret="env:TDC_HTTP_SECRET"` reads it from the environment, `secret="file:~/.tdc/service.key"` from a file the repository does not hold. A literal is a WARNING, because a service on 127.0.0.1 for an afternoon is a real use; `secret=""` is an error, because signing with nothing produces a signature anyone could forge |
| `TDC285` | A drawing attribute whose value is not one of its words, or not a number | `mode=`, `interp=`, `spread=` and `decimals=` were read only at render time, so `check` called `mode="banana"` valid and the run then refused it — the one place `check` did not answer "would this run?". Allowed: `mode="signal|density"`, `interp="linear|smooth|step"`, a non-negative `spread=`, a non-negative whole `decimals=` |
| `TDC286` | `<is_digit>` or `<encode>` was handed `<field name="_count">` or `<field name="_total">` | Those two fields arrive as NUMBERS; both tags want one character of text. `<is_digit>` answered "no" on every row — including the rows where the count is a single digit — and `check` said nothing; `<encode>` stopped the run with "expected a single-character string", naming no file and no line, on a config `check` had also called valid. Compare the number with `<equals>` or `<less_than>`, wrap it in `<concat>` for `<encode>`, or put the character you mean into a `<str>` |
| `TDC287` | `<equals>`, `<greater_than>` or `<less_than>` was given a `<str>` literal that is not a number | The three comparisons work on numbers. A `<str>` holding digits is read as the number it spells — `<equals><str v="7"/><int v="7"/></equals>` is true — so only a literal that is not a number is refused. That one used to stop the run with "expected an integer in `<equals>`, got the string …", naming no file and no line, on a config `check` had called valid. Only literals are checked: what a `<field>` will hold is not known before the run |
| `TDC288` | `<var>` — the tag was renamed to `<use>` | It never declared anything: `<let>` binds a name and this reads it back, which is what the new name says. Without a refusal of its own the old spelling fell through to "unknown compute tag", which says the spelling is wrong and not what the right one is. The `name=` attribute is unchanged |
| `TDC289` | `distinct=` was given something other than `true` or `false` | The attribute has two spellings and no third meaning. Treating an unrecognised word as `false` would leave a config that asks for distinct values and quietly gets repeats |
| `TDC290` | `distinct=` with no `repeat=` | One value cannot repeat itself, so the attribute would be read and then do nothing. Add `repeat="N"` or `repeat="A..B"`, or drop `distinct=` |
| `TDC291` | `percent=` and `distinct=` on the same `<gen>` | `percent=` promises exact proportions across the whole run; `distinct=` trades that promise away for a guarantee inside each row. Both cannot hold, so neither is silently dropped. For proportions over list LENGTHS, put them on a `<mix>` or `<switch>` outside, with `repeat=` on the `<gen>` inside |
| `TDC292` | `repeat=` under `distinct=` asks for more values than the list can offer | Five values cannot yield six different ones. Reported before the run where the pool is in the config (`type="text"`, a whole-number range, a one-character `symbol` set); at run time where it is not (a pack file, a CSV column, a regex), since those are only read while generating |
| `TDC293` | `<gen type="pattern">` without `y_range=` | A drawing has no scale of its own — the same curve leaves one tool running 0..100 and another 0..10002345345. `y_range="min..max"` is what those coordinates mean: it becomes the floor and ceiling of the drawing's canvas. Without it every answer would be a guess about somebody's export settings, so the attribute is required rather than assumed |
| `TDC294` | `<gen type="formula">` without `expr=`, or with an `expr=` that does not parse, or a `decimals=` outside 0..10 | A formula IS its expression, so there is nothing to compute without one. The expression is the same little language as `if=` — see [Expressions](expressions.md). A name inside it that is not a column declared above raises `TDC240` instead, the same code `running` and `stat` use for the same rule |
| `TDC295` | A derived column where it cannot mean anything: `running`, `stat` or a formula that reads `prev()` anywhere but as a whole `<sequence>`; any `formula` or date offset as a part or a field of a composed `<sequence>` | The first three read the rows before this one, or all of them, so they are whole columns — a `<case>` or an `if=` branch holds some rows and not others. Declare them as sequences of their own and use them by name. A record's parts are drawn and rearranged together, and a computed value moved to another row no longer describes it. A plain `formula` or date offset reads only its own row, so it may sit in a `<case>` or an `if=` branch |
| `TDC296` | A `running`, `stat`, `formula` or date-offset column, or a `<compute>`, inside `<uniq>` or `<distinct>` | A group REARRANGES finished columns until each record is unique. A drawn value means the same wherever it lands; a computed one describes the row it was computed for, so moving it makes the arithmetic wrong. Put the group around the columns this one READS and leave the computed column outside it — it follows whatever the group arranges |
| `TDC297` | Two readings of one file at once — `read="quantile"` beside `weight=`, `row=` or `order="sequential"`; a misspelled `read=`; `sample=` without it | `weight=` puts the shares in a second column, `row=` links several columns to one LINE, `order="sequential"` walks the list in order, and `read="quantile"` says the values ARE the distribution and a row lands anywhere on the sorted sample. Keep one reading: a countable value wants `weight=` and its exact quota, a measured one wants the quantile read |
| `TDC298` | One `row=` key over two different files | A link is one LINE of one file, so there is no line that belongs to both. Point every member of the link at the same `src=`, or give this one its own `row=` key |
| `TDC299` | _(warning)_ `uniq="true"` over 100,000 rows                          | Keeping a promise about the finished column costs memory that follows `count`, on every engine — the cost belongs to the promise, not to one of them. About 250 bytes a value, measured: 2,000,000 rows cost about 477 MB, and a compound `uniq` measures higher still. A single drawn column pays twice, because drawing without replacement cannot be done a row at a time, so that shape also runs in memory whatever `mode=` asks for. It works; it is worth being deliberate about |
| `TDC300` | `fit=` that is not a band, counts down, or sits beside `points=`/`upper=`/`lower=` | `fit="low..high"` says what the drawing's own lowest and highest point become on the value axis — it is how a curve read from `src=` gets placed, since a file carries a shape and no units. Two numbers, smaller first; turning the drawing upside down is a different request. Beside typed points it is refused: `80` there already means 80% of `y_range`, so there is nothing left to place. Omit it and the drawing fills `y_range` |
| `TDC301` | _(warning)_ A share list that leaves a declared value at 0% | A `percent` shorter than `value` is fine — what is left over goes to the positions you did not write, so `value="a,b,c" percent="30,40"` gives `c` the remaining 30. When the written shares already total 100 there is nothing left, and that value is declared and can never be drawn: `percent="50,50"` over 300 rows came out 150 `a`, 150 `b`, no `c`. A zero you write yourself — `percent="50,0,50"` — is taken at its word and says nothing |
| `TDC302` | A `<distinct>` or `<uniq>` over `<gen type="pool">` references that cannot mean anything: one beside an ordinary sequence, references to two different pools, or more references than the pool has members | A group over references compares WHICH MEMBER each row took, so the members must be comparable and there must be enough of them. Each of these three used to be accepted and then do nothing at all |
| `TDC303` | A `missing_when=` that decides nothing: no condition at all, no `missing=` rate beside it, or a `repeat=` cell under it | The condition names the mechanism — `missing_when="Age < 30"` is MAR, `missing_when="_value > 150000"` is MNAR — so a written-and-blank one is a question nobody finished asking, and one with no rate has no draw to gate. A repeated cell holds several values on one row while the condition asks about one, and rather than guess which reading you meant it is refused. All three used to be accepted and quietly ignored |
| `TDC304` | Seasonal lists that do not line up: `amplitude=` or `peak_at=` with a different number of entries from `period=`, or a `0` among several periods | `period="7,365" amplitude="120,400" peak_at="5,182"` describes the same two waves three times over, position by position, so a length that disagrees describes no wave anybody can draw — the extra entry used to be dropped and nothing said so. A single `amplitude` for waves of equal height is the one shorthand. `period="0"` alone means "no seasonal wave"; among several it is a wave with no length beside waves that have one |
| `TDC305` | A `noise_correlation=` that cannot be honoured: outside −1..1, or with no `noise=` beside it | It is how much of one row's jitter carries into the next. At 1 the series would wander off and never come back — a random walk, not noise — and above 1 it grows without bound; both are refused rather than clamped. Without `noise=` there is nothing to correlate, so the attribute decides nothing |
| `TDC306` | An `<assert>` carrying both `that=` and `each=` | They answer different questions and are checked a different number of times: `that=` once, over whole-run values, and `each=` on every row. One tag with both leaves a reader unable to tell which of the two the sentence in `says=` describes. Write two assertions, each with its own `says=`, so a failure says which one broke |
| `TDC307` | `distinct="true"` beside `order="sequential"` | `distinct=` draws the row's values without replacement, and a walked row draws nothing — its values are decided by its position. Honouring both is impossible, and quietly ignoring one is how a config comes to claim something it never had |
| `TDC308` | A condition on a `<gen>` — `if=` or `missing_when=` — naming a column declared below it | The condition is answered while this column is being built, so a column further down does not exist yet. The two engines disagreed about what to do with that, and both answers were defensible: the in-memory engine read it as empty and the condition never held, while the streaming engine built the column on demand and the condition resolved for real. Move the `<sequence>` it names above this one. A condition read after the row is finished — `<data if=>`, `<line if=>`, `<assert that=>` — may name any column |
