# Expressions

The little language with four homes, all reading the same way:

| Where             | It answers                                                                       |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `if=`             | whether a `<gen>`, a `<line>`, a `<case>` or a `<data>` takes part in this row    |
| `filter=`         | which members of a [pool](../pools/filter.md) this row may draw from             |
| `expr=`           | the VALUE of a [`formula`](../generators/formula.md) column                      |
| a distribution parameter | the value of `mean`, `sd`, `lambda` … [on this row](../guides/statistical-distributions.md#a-parameter-can-follow-another-column) |

The first two consume the answer as a yes/no and throw the value away; the last two keep
it. Same operators, same functions, same names for the same columns — which is what stops
a condition and a computed column from coming to mean different things by the same words.

```xml
<sequence name="Zone">
  <gen if="Country in [US, CA, MX]" type="text" value="NAFTA"/>
  <gen if="Country in [FR, DE]"     type="text" value="EU"/>
  <gen                              type="text" value="ROW"/>
</sequence>
<sequence name="Handling">
  <gen if="Weight > 20"      type="text" value="freight"/>
  <gen if="_count % 2 == 0"  type="text" value="courier-even"/>
  <gen                       type="text" value="parcel"/>
</sequence>
```

`./run shipping.tdc`

```
US NAFTA 2kg parcel
FR EU 14kg courier-even
CA NAFTA 7kg parcel
DE EU 30kg freight
MX NAFTA 5kg parcel
JP ROW 22kg freight
```

The last `<gen>` in each sequence has no `if=`, so it catches whatever the conditions above
did not — the same shape as an `else`.

## Values

| You write         | It means                                                                 |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Country`         | the value that sequence produced on this row                             |
| `Person.Email`    | a field of a [compound sequence](../core-concepts/sequences.md)         |
| `Gender.Male`     | "is Gender currently Male?" — the same reading as `parent="Gender.Male"` |
| `Male`            | a **bare word**: a name that is no sequence is its own text              |
| `42`, `1.5`       | a number                                                                 |
| `'text'`          | a quoted string, when the text has spaces or looks like a name           |
| `_count`, `_last` | a [built-in](builtins.md) — the row number, the last-row flag           |

A bare word is what lets `Gender == Male` be written without quotes. It also means a **typo
compares against itself and quietly matches nothing** — which is why an unknown name on the
right of a dot raises [TDC193](errors.md) rather than passing.

## Whole numbers

A double holds every integer up to 2⁵³ and then starts skipping, so an expression built on
doubles alone answers this way:

`what a double says about two different numbers`

```
9007199254740993 == 9007199254740992   true
9007199254740993 -  9007199254740992   0
```

Both wrong, and wrong without a word — which for a data generator is the worst kind of wrong,
because the run finishes and the file looks fine. So an operand that IS a whole number is
carried as one, and only becomes a double when something asks it to:

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| a literal without a point or an exponent | stays whole |
| a column whose value reads as digits | compares as whole against another whole |
| `+ - * %` on two whole numbers | stay whole |
| `abs` `round` `floor` `ceil` `trunc` on a whole number | stay whole — rounding a whole number is that number, whatever its size |
| `min` `max` `sum` while every argument is whole | stay whole |
| `/` | **always** floating point — division is not closed over the whole numbers |
| anything handed to `sqrt`, `log`, `sin`… | becomes a double, because those have no exact answer to give |

The domain is signed 64-bit, the same as the [compute layer](compute.md) — the widest integer
all five implementations hold natively. An arithmetic RESULT past it is a refusal, in the same
words compute uses, rather than a quiet slide back into floating point:

`tdcv2 ledger.tdc`

```
tdcv2: integer overflow: 9223372036854775808 is outside the signed 64-bit range
```

The refusal comes from the run, not from `check`: both operands are inside the domain and only
the answer is not, so there is nothing for the validator to prove.

A LITERAL wider than the domain is a different thing, and it is a double. `1 / 0 >
100000000000000000000` is how you write "bigger than any whole number we hold", and it works;
the price is that two literals that round to the same double compare equal, so
`10000000000000000000 == 10000000000000000001` is **true**. Write such a value as text if you
mean an identifier rather than a number.

One edge worth knowing: −2⁶³ can be reached by arithmetic but not written as a literal, since
`-9223372036854775808` is a minus sign applied to a magnitude one past the largest positive.

## Operators

| Group      | Operators                        |
| :--------- | :------------------------------- |
| comparison | `== != === !== < > <= >=`        |
| logic      | `&& \|\| !`                      |
| arithmetic | `+ - * / %`                      |
| membership | `in`                             |
| choice     | `a ? b : c`                      |

`+` **adds** whenever both sides read as numbers, and every column reads as text, so
`Price + Delivery` on two decimal columns is arithmetic and not a joined string. It
concatenates only when a side is genuinely not a number — `'a' + 'b'` is `ab`. To join
values deliberately, put them next to each other where they are printed:
`${{First}} ${{Last}}`.

`==` asks whether both sides are the same **number**; `===` asks whether they print the same
**characters**. Every column is text, so the two questions are genuinely different — see
[Comparison and truth](comparison.md), which also settles what counts as true for a bare
`if="Flag"`.

> [!CAUTION]

`in` takes a list on its right and nothing else — a list anywhere else raises
[TDC259](errors.md). Comparison inside it is as loose as `==`, so a text column against a
list of numeric words still matches.

```xml
<gen if="Country in [US, CA, MX]" .../>   <!-- instead of three == joined by || -->
```

The operators — comparisons, the logical connectives and arithmetic — are exact, built from
what IEEE-754 pins down, so the five implementations cannot disagree about them. The
FUNCTIONS in the table above are the ones TDC computes itself, which is why each carries an
accuracy bound rather than a promise of exactness.

## Repeatable randomness, and shapes to put it in

Five of the functions above exist for one job: building a value that VARIES the way real
data varies, without drawing at random. Each is a plain calculation on its arguments, so
the same arguments always give the same answer, in every implementation.

### `hash(n, salt)` — a repeatable value in [0, 1) from a pair of numbers

The one to reach for when every row wants its own coefficient:

```xml
<tdc><env count="5" seed="w">
  <sequence name="N"><gen type="increment" value="1"/></sequence>
  <sequence name="Amp"><gen type="formula" decimals="4"
       expr="1.4 * (0.94 + 0.12 * hash(N, 12.9))"/></sequence>
</env><block><line><data>${{N}},${{Amp}}</data></line></block></tdc>
```

```
1,1.3862
2,1.4128
3,1.4559
4,1.4518
5,1.4734
```

`salt` is what makes two columns of the same row differ: `hash(N, 1)` and `hash(N, 2)` are
unrelated sequences, so one row can carry several independent coefficients without a
second seed.

It replaces the shader trick — `sin(n * 12.9898) * 43758.5453`, minus its floor — that
config writers reach for. That trick is safe HERE, because TDC computes its own `sin` and
the five implementations agree on it to the last bit. What it costs is two transcendental
calls a row, which are computed in software, and a line nobody can read. `hash` is integer
arithmetic and says what it is.

### `noise(t, scale, salt)` — smooth drift

A fresh value every `scale` rows, eased between. This is what a wandering baseline
actually is, and three modulated sine waves cannot do it: measured over 4,096 samples, the
sines put 74.6 per cent of their power into three frequency bins where this puts 51.5.

```xml
<sequence name="Drift"><gen type="formula" expr="0.3 * (noise(_count, 300, 7) - 0.5)"/></sequence>
```

Two properties worth relying on, both exact rather than approximate:

- **At a lattice point the value IS `hash` there.** `noise(k * scale, scale, salt)` equals
  `hash(k, salt)` — the same bits, not the same to within an ulp — because the easing
  interpolates with `a * (1 - u) + b * u`. A cell boundary is therefore continuous.
- **The midpoint of a cell is the plain average of its ends.**

A `scale` of zero divides by zero and gives NaN, the same answer `sqrt(-1)` gives here. In
a column that is refused by name rather than printed, because a file full of `NaN` nobody
was warned about is worse than a run that stops.

### `gauss(x, c, w)` — a bell centred on `c`

`exp(-((x - c) / w)²)`: 1 at the centre, falling away on both sides, `w` sets the width.

```xml
<tdc><env count="7" seed="w">
  <sequence name="X"><gen type="increment" value="1"/></sequence>
  <sequence name="G"><gen type="formula" decimals="4" expr="gauss(X, 4, 1.5)"/></sequence>
</env><block><line><data>${{X}},${{G}}</data></line></block></tdc>
```

```
1,0.0183
2,0.1690
3,0.6412
4,1.0000
5,0.6412
6,0.1690
7,0.0183
```

Not a probability density — it is not scaled to integrate to one. It is the SHAPE, for
multiplying something else by.

### `clamp(x, lo, hi)` — hold a value inside a range

The guard rail on anything that accumulates. **If `lo` is greater than `hi`, the ceiling
wins**: `clamp(x, 9, 2)` is 2 for every `x`. The order matters and is stated rather than
left to whichever comparison the implementation happens to make first — the reference and
its four ports disagreed about it once, and a shared fixture is what caught it.

### `lerp(a, b, t)` — `t` of the way from `a` to `b`

**Exact at both ends**: `lerp(10, 20, 0)` is exactly 10 and `lerp(10, 20, 1)` is exactly
20. That is the reason it exists rather than being written out by hand: the natural
spelling `a + (b - a) * t` misses `b` at `t = 1` in 41 per cent of 200,000 random pairs,
because the subtraction loses low bits the addition cannot put back. This computes
`a * (1 - t) + b * t`, which cannot.

Outside [0, 1] it extrapolates rather than refusing — `lerp(10, 20, 2)` is 30 — because a
value that ran past its range is usually the caller's arithmetic, not a mistake, and
`clamp` is right there for when it is.

## A column that reads its own past

Every function above answers from ONE row. `prev(Column, initial)` is the exception: it
reads `Column` from the row before this one, and on the first row it gives `initial`
instead. That is what a random walk needs — each row is the previous row plus a step —
and what no expression could say before.

```xml
<env count="3600" seed="p001" mode="sequential">
  <sequence name="RR">
    <gen type="formula" decimals="3"
         expr="clamp(prev(RR, 700) + (hash(_count, 3) - 0.5) * 180, 350, 1400)"/>
  </sequence>
</env>
```

`prev` takes the column NAME, unevaluated. Writing `RR` anywhere else in that expression
would give you THIS row's value, which is the one thing `prev` exists to look past.

**It needs `mode="sequential"` on `<env>`, and says so if you forget.** The mode is a
promise that row N is computed after row N−1. Without it the engine is free to resolve any
row without touching the one before — that is how it streams a run larger than memory —
so `prev()` would be reading a row that does not exist yet.

> [!CAUTION]
> **`mode="sequential"` and `order="sequential"` are different things**
>
> `order="sequential"` on a `<gen>` walks that generator's values in the order they are
> written, instead of drawing at random. It is about ONE column's values.
>
> `mode="sequential"` on `<env>` is about the whole RUN: rows are computed one after another.
> The words match; the subjects do not.

What the mode costs, and what it refuses:

- The run is held in memory (engine 1), and the column-at-a-time optimisations are off.
  That is the honest price of a column that reads its own past, and only a config that
  asked for it pays.
- `mode="sequential"` together with `engine="2"` or `engine="3"` is refused, naming both
  attributes. Those engines resolve any row without the one before it — that is their
  design — so the two cannot both be honoured.
- `prev()` inside an `if=` is refused as well, and so is `prev()` inside a `filter=` or an
  assert — a condition is answered per row, and the engine answering it may take the rows in
  any order. The refusal says so rather than pointing at `mode="sequential"`, which in this
  case is already there. Compute the lookback in a `<gen type="formula">` and test that
  column instead.

Everything else still works beside it: `percent=`, `uniq` and `distinct` are unaffected,
because columns are registered in declaration order and that is the same order `prev()`
depends on.

## Lists inside one row

A sequence with `repeat=` puts several values in one field, joined by its `separator=`.
An expression sees the **joined text**, because that is what the field holds — so `split`
is how a list becomes a list, and everything else works on what it hands back.

```xml
<sequence name="Prices">
  <gen type="number" value="10..200" repeat="3" separator=","/>
</sequence>
<sequence name="Basket">
  <gen if="sum(split(Prices, ',')) > 300" type="text" value="large"/>
  <gen type="text" value="ordinary"/>
</sequence>
```

`min` and `max` read a list as readily as loose arguments: `max(split(Prices, ','))` and
`max(1, 9, 4)` both work. An empty separator cuts into single characters, the same unit
`len` counts, so `count(split(s, ''))` and `len(s)` never disagree.

> [!NOTE]
> **`at` counts from zero, and refuses an index that is not one**
>
> `at(list, 0)` is the first element. **Past the end is empty text** — deliberately, because
> `repeat="1..4"` makes rows of different lengths on purpose, and asking for the third element
> of a two-element row is a real question with an empty answer. Use `count(list)` to ask
> first.
>
> Everything else is refused rather than answered with that same empty string: a negative
> index, a fractional one, an index that is not a number, and a subject that was never split.
> That last one is the mistake everybody makes first —
>
> ```xml
> <gen if="at(Prices, 1) > 100" …/>   <!-- refused: TDC260 -->
> <gen if="at(split(Prices, ','), 1) > 100" …/>   <!-- what was meant -->
> ```
>

## Why TDC computes its own transcendentals

IEEE-754 gives `+ - * /` and `sqrt` exactly one legal answer each, so every language agrees
about them. It says nothing about `sin`, `cos`, `exp`, `log` or `pow` — each libm picks its
own algorithm — and the gap is measurable, not theoretical:

| | `tan(1)` |
| :--- | :--- |
| Node | `3ff8eb245cbee3a6` |
| Python | `3ff8eb245cbee3a5` |

Sixteen of seventy-seven sampled values disagree somewhere across the five implementations.
In a `timeseries` that never shows, because every number is rounded to a decimal string
before it becomes output — the last bit dies on the way out. A comparison has no rounding
step, so that bit becomes a different row, and a different file, on a tool whose whole
promise is that five implementations produce the same bytes.

So TDC computes these itself, the way it already computes its own random numbers rather than
trusting each language's. Every one lands within **4 ulp** of the true value — the same
neighbourhood a libm occupies — and, far more importantly, on the **same** double in all five.
Matching any particular libm is not the goal and could not be: the libms do not match each
other.

That 4 is checked rather than claimed, on grids that run to the ends of each function's range.
The ends are where it matters: a series truncated two terms early is invisible in the middle
of an interval and thirteen ulp out at the edge, which is exactly the bug the check was
written after.

`pow` is the one function with a wider bound, for a reason worth knowing:

| exponent | how it is computed | drift |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| whole, or a half | repeated squaring, `sqrt` for the half | grows with the exponent — ~4 ulp at 3, ~22 at 20 |
| anything else | `exp(y · log x)` | grows with \|y · log x\| — ~2 ulp at 1, ~457 at 400 |

Both come from amplification, not from a defect: squaring doubles whatever error it was
handed, and `exp` turns an absolute error in its argument into a relative one in its answer.
Twelve significant digits survive either way.

```xml
<sequence name="Month"><gen type="increment" value="1"/></sequence>
<sequence name="Load">
  <gen if="cos(Month / 2) > 0.5"  type="text" value="peak"/>
  <gen if="cos(Month / 2) < -0.5" type="text" value="trough"/>
  <gen                            type="text" value="normal"/>
</sequence>
<sequence name="Tier">
  <gen if="pow(2, Month) > 100" type="text" value="large"/>
  <gen                          type="text" value="small"/>
</sequence>
```

`tdcv2 seasonal.tdc`

```
1 peak small
2 peak small
3 normal small
4 normal small
5 trough small
6 trough small
7 trough large
8 trough large
```

That file was run through all five implementations and produced those bytes in every one.

Two things follow from computing them rather than borrowing them. `pow` with a whole-number
exponent goes through repeated squaring, so `pow(10, 3)` is exactly 1000 rather than
999.9999999999998 — a config comparing against a round number would have noticed. And the
circular functions take **radians**, with no degree variant: one convention, stated once.

### The pair that exists because subtraction loses things

`expm1` and `log1p` are not shorthands for `exp(x) - 1` and `log(1 + x)`. They are those
expressions computed so that the answer survives:

`near zero, the definitions return nothing`

```
expm1(1e-20)   1e-20        exp(1e-20) - 1     0
log1p(1e-20)   1e-20        log(1 + 1e-20)     0
```

The second column is not a rounding error — it is the whole answer, gone. `1 + 1e-20` IS 1 as a
double, so the logarithm never sees the argument at all; and `exp(1e-20)` is 1.0000…, so the
subtraction cancels every digit that mattered. `asinh` and `atanh` are built on `log1p` for the
same reason, and inherit the accuracy.

`hypot` avoids the mirror-image problem at the other end of the range: `sqrt(x² + y²)` overflows
to infinity for x = 10²⁰⁰, though the answer is perfectly representable. And `log2` separates the
exponent before taking any logarithm, so `log2(8)` is 3 rather than 2.9999999999999996.

### Where the bound stops being a number of ulp

Four of these carry a bound that is not simply "within 4 ulp", and saying so is
part of the reference rather than a footnote:

| Function | What holds |
| :--- | :--- |
| `erf` | within 4 ulp |
| `erfc` | within 8 ulp — it passes through e^(−x²), and that exponential carries the rounding of the square |
| `gamma` | **exact** on whole numbers to 23, within 7 ulp on all 171 a double can hold; twelve significant digits elsewhere |
| `lgamma` | within 32 ulp away from its zeros; the meaningful bound AT x = 1 and x = 2 is absolute, under 10⁻¹³ |

`lgamma` is the interesting one. It is zero at 1 and at 2, and no method that
adds up terms of size 1 can be *relatively* accurate about their cancelling to
nothing — the claim there has to be absolute, and it is. Both zeros come out
exactly zero.

`gamma` off the whole numbers ends in an exponential, so its drift grows with
log Γ(x) itself: the same amplification `pow` has, for the same reason. That is
why a whole number takes the factorial path instead.

## What is deliberately absent

**The mathematics a data generator has no business carrying.** `besselj`, `bessely`, `airy`,
`elliptic_k`, `elliptic_e` and `polygamma` are refused by name rather than guessed at:

`tdcv2 check seasonal.tdc`

```
error[TDC257]: besselj() is not available yet in an if expression
```

Note what it does NOT say: "did you mean `beta`?" Edit distance would have offered exactly
that, and the two name entirely different functions. A name on this list is answered with
the reason instead.

Each of these is a project rather than a function, and none has ever plausibly belonged in a
row predicate. They stay on the list so that a person who reaches for one gets an answer
rather than "unknown function".

**Loops and recursion.** The engine is chosen from the config before a row is generated,
[`preflight()`](../guides/large-outputs.md) estimates memory before the run, and `--jobs`
splits rows across workers. All three need to know the work per row without doing it. A loop
breaks all three, and what people reach for a loop to express — "is this row even?" — is
`%`.

**Bitwise operators.** `_count & 1` is `_count % 2` written for a machine. They parse, so
the message can name them, and then they are refused.

## When an expression is not enough

A [`<compute>` sequence](compute.md) has integer division, remainders, string surgery,
encodings and checksums. It produces a value like any other sequence, and `if=` then compares
that:

```xml
<sequence name="Checksum">
  <compute><result><mod><to_number><field name="Account"/></to_number><int v="97"/></mod></result></compute>
</sequence>
<sequence name="Flag">
  <gen if="Checksum == 0" type="text" value="divisible"/>
  <gen type="text" value="."/>
</sequence>
```

## The config is XML-shaped, but it is not XML

TDC does not expand entities, so `&lt;` is four literal characters rather than `<`. Write the
raw character:

```xml
<gen if="Weight > 20" .../>      <!-- yes -->
<gen if="Weight &gt; 20" .../>   <!-- no: TDC103, the entity is four characters -->
```
