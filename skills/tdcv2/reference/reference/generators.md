## Cross-cutting attributes

These work on almost any generator (see [Masks & case](../guides/masks-and-case.md)):

- `case=` / `mask=` — letter case and display masks.
- `missing=` — leave a share of the cells blank.

Four types refuse all three ([TDC015](errors.md)), and for one reason:
[`formula`](../generators/formula.md), [`running`](../generators/running.md) and
[`stat`](../generators/stat.md) are resolved in declaration order, before the formatting
layer runs, and [`pool`](../pools/overview.md) hands the row a whole member rather than a
value of its own. Refused rather than ignored, because the answer exists one step later
and is better: the interpolation filter runs where the value is PRINTED, so
`${{Weight|mask:x}}` and `${{Doctor.name|upper}}` work today.

The next two only work when the generator produces something they can act on — and they
part ways on what happens elsewhere: `order=`/`cycle=` are REFUSED, `anomaly=` is about the
value rather than the generator:

- `order=` / `cycle=` — value order: random by default, or `sequential`. Ordering walks
  something, so exactly three generators read it: [`text`](../generators/text.md),
  [`file`](../generators/file.md) and [`date`](../generators/date.md) — a date range is
  walked a step at a time. **On every other type it is refused** ([TDC015](errors.md)),
  not ignored: a [`number`](../generators/number.md) draws from a range and has no order
  to walk, and neither has a regex, a template, a symbol, a counter, a drawing, a series
  or a statistic.
- `anomaly=` — push a share of the values out of range by multiplying them. The rule is
  about the **value**, not the generator: anything that reads as a number is multiplied,
  including a numeric string from [`text`](../generators/text.md),
  [`file`](../generators/file.md) or a pack. A non-numeric value beside numeric ones — a
  name in a mixed list — passes through unchanged, because there is no "further out" for
  it. A list with **no** numbers at all is refused ([TDC243](errors.md)): nothing there
  could ever be pushed out of range, so the attribute would do nothing on every row.
