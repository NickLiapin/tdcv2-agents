# Tags reference

Every tag in the TDC DSL, and where each one is covered in depth.

## Checking the run

| Tag        | What it is                                                    | See                                                             |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<assert>` | A property the finished run must have, or it stops with a message | [Self-checking configs](../constructs/self-checking.md) |

`<data>` is listed twice because it reads two ways. Inside a `<line>` it is output:
literal text with `${{…}}` interpolated into it. Inside a `<sequence>` it is data:
bare, it is the glue between the generators of a
[composed sequence](../core-concepts/sequences.md#a-composed-sequence); with a
`name`, it is a [constant field](../core-concepts/sequences.md#a-constant-field) and
the only field that costs no draw.

Compute tags (the ones that go inside `<compute>`) have their own list in the
[Compute functions reference](compute.md).
